['This simple household item saves lives'],"[""Erin Zaikis often used to think about how she could help change the world, but it wasn't until she got very sick with dengue fever that she decided to take action."", ""In high school, Zaikis' mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the teen slipped into depression -- trapped in what she described as a cycle of feeling sorry for herself. In college, she took a course in global poverty, which helped put her own struggles in perspective. And at 19, the Boston native traveled to Mumbai, where she spent a summer living in an orphanage that housed around 100 girls, some of whom had been left in trash cans or abandoned in train stations."", '""I\'m from a middle-, upper-class town and had never been exposed to extreme poverty, or starvation, or issues like child trafficking,"" Zaikis said. ""It was life-changing.""', ""After graduating, Zaikis, now 24, traveled to Thailand, where she worked with organizations that fight child trafficking. She visited schools to assess children's risk of being trafficked and to match them with local vocational programs."", ""During one such visit, she watched as middle school-age children entered and left a bathroom without washing their hands. With the help of a translator, she asked the children if they had soap, and was startled to learn they didn't know what soap was. The closest shop that sold it was a several-hour walk away. Zaikis made the trek and bought roughly 150 bars of pink and blue soap, which cost her $30 U.S."", '""Cigarettes were much more expensive, but cigarettes were bought by almost everyone in the community,"" Zaikis said. ""I really think the problem did not lie in the cost of soap, but rather the education. No one has spent the time to take these children aside and teach them how to wash their hands.""', 'Zaikis knew her soap purchase was a temporary fix, and made plans to spend the summer partnering with schools and local organizations on hygiene projects. But within days, she collapsed and was rushed to the hospital with dengue hemorrhagic fever -- an often deadly infection spread by mosquitos. Her parents took her back to Boston, where she was treated at Massachusetts General Hospital.', '""It was a really horrible couple of months,"" Zaikis said. ""But I think I really needed that because I realized, one, life is short. And two, I could have died of dengue fever if I had stayed in this rural area. ... I felt incredibly fortunate to have survived, and realized I really wanted to dedicate my life to helping other people.""', 'Once Zaikis recovered, she took a computer coding class and began searching for soap recipes. ""The first soap burnt all my bowls and dishes,"" she laughed. ""I set off the fire alarm. I cut my hand five times."" She slowly perfected the process as well as the ingredients, testing her concoctions on herself, then finally on friends and family.', 'Roughly one month ago, Zaikis launched the website for Sundara, where she sells three handmade soaps, each inspired by a different country, and each shaped like a flower.', 'The Thailand soap is scented with lemongrass and pomelo, and a dollar from the sale of each soap supports the Hug Project\'s mission of funding medical professionals who schedule health visits with ""street boys"" and children at risk of being trafficked, as well as providing them with hygiene kits. Proceeds from the lavender and shea butter soap go to Ghana, where the Unlock Foundation is funding the construction of a sink and well in one school and supplying soap to the area, while proceeds from the chai tea soap go toward Gabriel Project Mumbai, which trains women in the community to lead hygiene workshops in schools located in local slums.', 'The goal, Zaikis said, is to help educate children about hygiene, and to give them the tools to protect themselves -- an uphill climb. The United Nations estimates that some 2,000 children younger than 5 die every day from diarrheal diseases, and the majority of those deaths are tied to water, sanitation and hygiene.', ""Zaikis works on Sundara full time, making all of the soaps and their packaging by hand. The business helps her pay rent on the Manhattan apartment she shares with her sister, but Zaikis frequently takes babysitting and dog-sitting jobs to supplement her income. She used money she'd saved while living in Thailand to buy soap ingredients -- things like spirulina and kelp -- which now crowd her apartment."", 'Her personal favorite is the chai soap. ""Whenever I use it in the shower, I start thinking about tea, and I think, \'Oh, this smells edible!\'"" she said. ""It\'s just a fun one to smell.""', 'Zaikis plans to expand Sundara and to begin working with refugee women in New York to teach them how to make the soap. The happiness she gets from her work and from seeing photos of completed projects funded by her donations, she said, is unlike anything else.', '""Every day I ask myself, what am I doing for other people?"" she said. ""This soap company is a great way to have fun, and learn about business, but more importantly, to help other people. ... It\'s a way to serve in some small way, and help someone who needs it.""', 'Zaikis with her soaps, which she makes by hand in her New York City apartment.']",1

I’m happily married, BUT . . . I can’t help but wonder . . . We recently reconnected . . . I know I need to move on . . . Please, help . . . What should I do?', 'If you spend enough time reading advice columns, you notice a pattern. In the stream of sorrows and quandaries and relationship angst, one word bubbles up again and again. First. My first love. My first time. My first ever. And unlike all the relationships that came after, with this one, the past can’t seem to stay in the past.', 'Because long after it ends, our first love maintains some power over us. A haunting, bittersweet hold on our psyches, pulling us back to what was and what can never be again. Unless . . . ?', 'But why? Why should this one lodge in our brains any differently than the others, even when the others were longer, better, more right? They just weren’t quite as intense as the first.', 'The scientific research on this topic is thin, but the collective wisdom among psychologists says it’s a lot like skydiving. Meaning, you’ll remember the first time you jumped out of an airplane much more clearly than the 10th time you took the leap.', '""Your first experience of something is going to be well remembered, more than later experiences,"" explains Art Aron, a psychology professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook who specializes in close relationships. ""Presumably there’d be more arousal and excitement, especially if it’s somewhat scary. And falling in love is somewhat scary — you’re afraid you’ll be rejected, you’re afraid you won’t live up to their expectations, afraid they won’t live up to yours. Anxiety is a big part of falling in love, especially the first time.""', 'So the relationship embeds itself in us in a way that all those who follow never can. Not that the subsequent loves aren’t as good. For most people, hopefully, the ones that come later, that last, are ultimately more nourishing, steadier and more solid. But this doesn’t stop anyone from clicking on their first love’s new profile picture when it pops up on Facebook. You know, just to see.', 'It’s possible, Aron says, that the experience is magnified because, for many, it happens during adolescence, when hormones are raging, and every life experience — a bad grade, a big win, a family fight — feels magnified. Even in a fully developed adult brain, ""the neurological response to being in love with someone is very strong,"" he says. ""It’s the same as being on cocaine. It’s this huge desire.""', 'Jefferson Singer, a Connecticut College psychologist whose research focuses on autobiographical memory, says that most people have something he calls a ""memory bump"" between age 15 and 26. ""They recall more memories, and they tend to be more positive memories,"" he says. That’s because we experience so many ""firsts"" during this period, but also because, after the fact, ""we have more opportunity to rehearse it and replay it, rethink it, reimagine it, re-experience it.""', 'And for first loves, he adds, ""I also think it becomes, to some degree, a template. It becomes what we measure everything else against."" Which can become a dangerous game, of course, if your first relationship was exciting, but volatile and unhealthy. Seeking those same highs and lows may lead to frustration at best, wreckage at worst.', 'Nancy Kalish has spent more than two decades studying couples who reunite after many years apart.

In your first instance of requited romance, everything feels new, ""and together you decide what love is.""', 'Kalish says there’s ""nothing magical about first love,"" beyond the fact that it happened to be the first. But there is something magical about couples whose love was interrupted and then rekindled later in life. With Facebook, this has become an ever more frequent occurrence.', 'The pairs who reunite successfully often fit a certain profile, says Kalish. They were younger than 24 when they dated, they grew up in the same place and broke up for some external reason — their parents didn’t approve, or someone moved away or shipped off to war.', 'During my years as The Washington Post’s wedding reporter, I wrote about several such couples, including Denise Pavone and Jeff Storck, who dated as teens on Long Island in the 1970s but broke up because of a miscommunication when Jeff left for college.', 'When they found each other in a Washington suburb 35 years later, they quickly fell in love all over again. ""It’s like 35 years never happened,"" Storck said before their 2010 wedding. Today, after more than five years of marriage, he sees two versions of Denise. ""I see her as she is,"" he says. ""But I still look at her and see the 16-year-old that I remember.""', 'Kalish says her research has found that when both parties to a first love are truly available when they reunite — either single, widowed or divorced — the relationships have a 70 percent success rate. But many of the people she hears from these days are heartsick, rather than happy. A survey she conducted two years ago found that two-thirds of the people who found their lost love were married at the time of the reunion.', 'Singer, the psychologist who studies memory, has one more theory about why the thought of a first love can remain so fresh and alluring, even after decades go by. Perhaps especially after decades go by.', '""I think it’s not just about the other person. It’s about who we were at that time,"" he says. ""We’re relishing the image of ourselves.

This also burns off excess water, which increases the heat capacity and thermal conductivity of the coals.', 'And while it’s tempting to want to run across hot coals, this actually pushes your feet deeper into the embers, increasing the burn risk. A nice steady walking pace is best. (Some say wetting your feet beforehand can add protection via the Leidenfrost effect, but Willey has found the effects of this to be negligible and prefers to firewalk dry-footed.)', 'Back in 1998, Willey and Kjetil Kjernsmo of University of Oslo developed a computer model of a fire walker’s foot, and then compared it to infrared imagery of people fire walking in Seattle.

Blue tang fish are found in areas around Indonesia and the Philippines, where there aren’t very many rules or regulations about large-scale fish collection.

['Is it possible to kill someone with farts? An investigation:'],"[""Last month there was a deadly gas leak at a Dupont facility in La Porte, Texas. Four people died from asphyxiation when a bad valve let huge quantities of the noxious gas methyl mercaptan leak into an area where employees were working, and their deaths would have been preceded by a nasty, familiar odor—one that's present in rotting cabbage, and, yes, your butt."", ""Farts contain not just methyl mercaptan, but other asphyxiants like methane and dimethyl sulfides. Here's the question though: Let's say you were John Doe from Se7en, and farting were a deadly sin. Could you actually kill someone with farts?"", 'I\'m pretty strict on what I mean when I say ""kill"" someone with farts:', 'The victim would have to be an otherwise healthy person—no farts so smelly they make your grandma have a heart attack. You would have to use some combination of farts and a closed space or mask, but nothing that could be considered a weapon—no plastic bags over the head. You would have to be able to kill them within a few hours for it to be considered a fart-related death—no infections caused by airborne intestinal bacteria. The farts themselves would have to deliver the fatal injury—no farting out so many greenhouse gasses you cause climate change–related natural disasters.', ""Here's what I discovered:"", 'Farts Can Be Toxic', ""Estimates vary on exactly how much of every gas is in every fart, because what you've been eating determines what's in your digestive tract—apart from a very small percentage of smell-producing gasses that make up a kind of smell signature."", 'The gasses in your farts that can kill someone are called asphyxiants, which are very different from cytotoxic agents like mustard gas, which damage your cells on contact. Nitrogen, a gas that can be used to execute prisoners is the asphyxiant found in greatest quantity in farts. Flammable methane is another such asphyxiant, and can constitute a large percentage of your fart gas.', ""Your farts also don't have much oxygen in them. The National Institutes of Health told me they don't keep data on the subject, so I had to get my data from wacky trivia books. Still, reliable sources say the oxygen in your farts comes entirely from air you swallow while you eat and drink, making it a small percentage, much of which is absorbed by your intestines during the digestive process. The best estimate I can find is that 3 to 5 percent of a fart is oxygen."", 'So if you were breathing pure farts, you would very quickly use up the oxygen they contain, and the methane and nitrogen would displace the oxygen anyway.', 'It Would Take Multiple People', 'But could you hold someone under your bedsheets and asphyxiate them by farting? No—you can see just how little gas there actually is in a fart from the video above. But there are known specifics about the volume of farts.', ""The authority on this is Dr. Michael D. Levitt, chief of staff at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who has published perhaps 300 papers on the subject. He concluded that there's only about 110 milliliters of gas in a normal fart. Still, a legendary, once-in-a-lifetime super-sized fart might just be enough to fill someone's lungs—an average person's lung capacity is around 500 milliliters. But you have to think bigger than that."", 'How About a Convoluted, Horror Movie-Type Scenario?', 'Fart gas is unbreathable air, and if you were able to fill a scuba tank with it by saving up your farts for a year, and then make someone breathe the resulting gas, they would die from lack of oxygen. That would be a step removed from killing someone with farts , though, and the puzzled detectives on the case might not even reach the conclusion that the gas was farts, unless they smelled it.', 'Any decent movie killer who used farts as a weapon would require that the victim be aware of the farts\' exiting the rectums of the farter, or more likely farters. I\'m imagining a cafeteria full of captives who had just eaten a bunch of gas-causing food. I asked the National Institutes of Health what foods cause farts, and they pointed me toward meals rich in short-chain carbohydrates, causing excessive, gas-producing fermentation in the gut. ""Fructans, galacto-oligosaccharides, polyols, fructose and lactose,"" would be the menu in a fart factory—a bunch of onions, baby food, and milk, basically.', ""Isolating the farts from the outside atmosphere would be tricky though, requiring a vacuum seal around the butts of the captives having their farts harvested. Does such a thing exist? Yes. It's called a space toilet."", 'Though not designed to capture farts, a space toilet could theoretically do the job, although it would take a little bit of a redesign, and the first few farts would have oxygen-rich air mixed in. But over the course of six hours strapped to a space toilet, a person would produce about ten ounces of gas, according to Dr. Levitt.', 'Once the fart tubes, connected to a roomful of people, were feeding their farts to your victim\'s breathing mask, asphyxia would start pretty quickly. Simulations of inert gas asphyxiation (in which no oxygen at all was present) conducted by The International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project, show that ""after just two or three breaths of nitrogen, the oxygen concentration in the lungs would be low enough for some oxygen already in the bloodstream to exchange back to the lungs and be eliminated by exhalation.""', 'The victim would feel no unusual sensation, since the urgent need to gulp air when you hold your breath comes from buildup of carbon dioxide, not lack of oxygen. ""Loss of consciousness may be accompanied by convulsions"" the Hypoxia Project pointed out, ""followed by cyanosis and cardiac arrest.""', ""An oxygen-deprived brain takes about seven minutes to die, which by my calculations would require a formidable 605 farts if the victim continued breathing until brain death, which is unlikely. But since 3 to 5 percent of the gas you're using is oxygen it might take a bit longer. This would require your fart factory to contain hundreds of people with major gas."", 'TL;DR:', ""It would take a large room of people strapped to space toilets, piped into your victim's breathing mask, or into a gas chamber.

Aside from a thinner design, better water-resistance and a step toward a future iPhone with no ports at all , people who decide to upgrade and purchase new Lightning headphones will enjoy much higher-quality sound. And beyond that, Apple’s move is pushing other companies to embrace the Lightning connector, which means they can improve their products as a result.', 'Here’s a perfect example: Check out these noise cancelling earbuds from Bose . They’re fantastic and they actively cancel noise rather than just isolate sound like regular earbuds.

Why now? That’s right, it’s because the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus won’t have 3.5mm audio ports.', 'Sure there are drawbacks — using Lightning headphones instead of older headphones means you can only connect them to Apple devices.

This leads to the belief that, When (blank) happens, I'll finally be happy."", ""While these major events do make us happy at first, research shows this happiness doesn't last. A study from Northwestern University measured the happiness levels of regular people against those who had won large lottery prizes the year prior. The researchers were surprised to discover that the happiness ratings of both groups were practically identical."", 'The mistaken notion that major life events dictate your happiness and sadness is so prevalent that psychologists have a name for it: impact bias. The reality is, event-based happiness is fleeting.', ""Happiness is synthetic you either create it, or you don't. Happiness that lasts is earned through your habits. Supremely happy people have honed habits that maintain their happiness day in, day out. Try out their habits, and see what they do for you:"", ""1. They slow down to appreciate life's little pleasures."", 'By nature, we fall into routines. In some ways, this is a good thing. It saves precious brainpower and creates comfort. However, sometimes you get so caught up in your routine that you fail to appreciate the little things in life. Happy people know how important it is to savor the taste of their meal, revel in the amazing conversation they just had, or even just step outside to take a deep breath of fresh air.', '2. They exercise.', 'Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a neurotransmitter that makes your brain feel soothed and keeps you in control of your impulses. Happy people schedule regular exercise and follow through on it because they know it pays huge dividends for their mood.', '3. They spend money on other people.', 'Research shows that spending money on other people makes you much happier than spending it on yourself. This is especially true of small things that demonstrate effort, such as going out of your way to buy your friend a book that you know they will like.', '4. They surround themselves with the right people.', ""Happiness spreads through people. Surrounding yourself with happy people builds confidence, stimulates creativity, and it's flat-out fun. Hanging around negative people has the opposite effect. They want people to join their pity party so that they can feel better about themselves. Think of it this way: If a person were smoking, would you sit there all afternoon inhaling the second-hand smoke? You'd distance yourself, and you should do the same with negative people."", '5. They stay positive.', ""Bad things happen to everyone, including happy people. Instead of complaining about how things could have been or should have been, happy people reflect on everything they're grateful for. Then they find the best solution available to the problem, tackle it, and move on. Nothing fuels unhappiness quite like pessimism. The problem with a pessimistic attitude, apart from the damage it does to your mood, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you expect bad things, you're more likely to experience negative events. Pessimistic thoughts are hard to shake off until you recognize how illogical they are. Force yourself to look at the facts, and you'll see that things are not nearly as bad as they seem."", '6. They get enough sleep.', ""I've beaten this one to death over the years and can't say enough about the importance of sleep to improving your mood, focus, and self-control. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, removing toxic proteins that accumulate during the day as byproducts of normal neuronal activity. This ensures that you wake up alert and clear-headed. Your energy, attention, and memory are all reduced when you don't get enough quality sleep. Sleep deprivation also raises stress hormone levels on its own, even without a stressor present. Happy people make sleep a priority, because it makes them feel great and they know how lousy they feel when they're sleep deprived."", '7. They have deep conversations.', 'Happy people know that happiness and substance go hand-in-hand. They avoid gossip, small talk, and judging others. Instead they focus on meaningful interactions. They engage with other people on a deeper level, because they know that doing so feels good, builds an emotional connection, and is an interesting way to learn.', '8. They help others.', ""Taking the time to help people not only makes them happy, but it also makes you happy. Helping other people gives you a surge of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine, all of which create good feelings. In a Harvard study, employees who helped others were 10 times more likely to be focused at work and 40% more likely to get a promotion. The same study showed that people who consistently provided social support were the most likely to be happy during times of high stress. As long as you make certain that you aren't overcommitting yourself, helping others is sure to have a positive influence on your mood."", '9. They make an effort to be happy.', ""No one wakes up feeling happy every day and supremely happy people are no exception. They just work at it harder than everyone else. They know how easy it is to get sucked into a routine where you don't monitor your emotions or actively try to be happy and positive. Happy people constantly evaluate their moods and make decisions with their happiness in mind."", '10. They have a growth mindset.', ""People's core attitudes fall into one of two categories: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. With a fixed mindset, you believe you are who you are and you cannot change. This creates problems when you're challenged, because anything that appears to be more than you can handle is bound to make you feel hopeless and overwhelmed. People with a growth mindset believe that they can improve with effort. This makes them happier because they are better at handling difficulties. They also outperform those with a fixed mindset because they embrace challenges, treating them as opportunities to learn something new."", 'Happiness can be tough to maintain, but investing in the right habits pays off.

In fact, research has discovered that doing isolated exercises (like bicep curls and tricep extensions) will NOT help you build lean muscle and get toned & fit.', 'When you do these ""isolated"" exercises, you’re only working one muscle at a time. The problem is that these exercises do very little to increase your metabolism.', 'Here’s why: In order to boost your metabolism, your heart rate has to be raised to a certain level. But when you’re only working ONE muscle at a time, it’s virtually impossible to recruit enough muscle fibers to increase your heart rate significantly, so you’ll never be able to spike your metabolism or maximize your calorie burn.', 'If you want to slim down and tone up fast, you need to do exercises that stimulate as many muscles as possible at the same time. On the next page, I’ll show you the most effective exercises that target every inch of your body—so you can replace flab with lean, defined muscle.', 'But first, here are the 5 WORST exercise mistakes you MUST stop making (if you want to burn off stubborn body fat and KEEP it off)...', 'Mistake #1: Doing Long Bouts of Cardio', 'If you’ve been doing cardio workouts to try and slim down, I have some alarming news...', 'Steady-state cardio (like jogging or doing the elliptical) increases the production of a stress hormone called cortisol. Cortisol causes weight gain and makes it more difficult to burn off stubborn belly fat.', 'That’s why no matter how much cardio you do, you can’t seem to raise your metabolism and you always hit a plateau eventually.', 'Even worse, too much cardio accelerates aging! When you put your body under prolonged stress, you start producing free-radicals, which damages your cells and causes inflammation...and inflammation is what makes you OLD. Yikes!', 'But, there is a RIGHT way to do cardio. Stick with me because I’m going to reveal what you can do to get insane results in half the time of your regular cardio workout—without causing unnecessary stress on your joints. (Once you learn this simple trick, you’ll kick yourself for not doing it all along!)', 'Mistake #2: Doing Crunches & Sit-Ups To Get Flat Abs', 'When you do ab-targeted exercises (like sit-ups, crunches or side bends), your muscles get sore, which makes you think you’re strengthening your abs. There you are, crunching away thinking it’s only a matter of time before you’ll be looking beach ready with your rock-solid core.', '...Yet weeks after you’ve religiously been doing your ab routine, your belly looks just as bloated and soft as it did before. All that time and pain for nothing!', 'Here’s the TRUTH...', 'Your abs were not designed to crunch, twist, and bend. In fact, it’s the complete opposite! The real role of your abdominal muscles is to prevent your mid-section from crunching, twisting, and bending. That’s right, your abs are a stabilizing force designed to resist movement in order to protect your spine.', 'So even though you ""feel the burn"" when you do crunches and sit-ups, you’re actually putting unnecessary pressure on your back, causing much more harm than good. These ab-targeted exercises can cause lower back injuries by forcing your spine to flex too much, and they do very little to actually strengthen your abs.', 'The key to getting sculpted abs is to burn off that stubborn layer of belly fat that’s hiding them. In the next few minutes, I’ll show you how to burn away the ""ab flab"" while stimulating all 6 of your abdominal muscles simultaneously — so you can finally carve out those lean, ripped abs.', 'Mistake #3: Using Gym Machines', 'Those big, shiny machines sure make the gym look high-end, but truthfully, the only thing they’re good for is for sitting down while you tie your shoes or catch your breath!', 'The problem is this: Machines alter the way your body naturally moves, restricting your range of motion. This severely limits your ability to fully activate all of your muscles fibers, which means less fat burning and less muscle toning.', 'Worse yet, machines can cause muscular imbalance and excessive strain on your joints, leading to nagging injuries down the road.', 'If you want fast results, you MUST incorporate exercises that allow your body to move naturally with full range of motion so you can skyrocket your metabolism and put fat-burning on autopilot.', 'In a minute, I’ll explain the 6 primary movements that are the foundation of these exercises...and I’ll also fill you in on the best types of weights to use for your workouts (no big, clunky gym machines required!).', 'Mistake #4: Repeating The Same Workouts Over & Over', 'Repeating the same workout routine over and over is a surefire way to STOP getting results. We’re creatures of habit and we tend to stick to things we’re familiar with and good at. But when it comes to working out, if you want to make progress and keep seeing changes in your body, you’ve got to start switching things up.', 'You see, your body has an amazingly ability to adapt quickly and when it does, that’s when you hit the dreaded plateau and you STOP making progress.', 'In a few minutes, I’m going to tell you exactly how often you need to change up your workout routine so you can keep your body guessing, which will keep your metabolism running on high so you can kiss that spare tire goodbye...', 'Mistake #5: Doing Loooong Workouts', 'Longer workouts do NOT equal better or faster results. If you’ve been slaving away at the gym and your body isn’t visibly changing, you can’t do more of the same thing and expect a different result.', 'When it comes to getting lean and fit, your body responds to quality over quantity. I’m going to tell you the #1 way to super-charge your workouts—this simple, yet overlooked method is the single fastest way to getting lean and ripped while cutting your workout time almost in half. This technique will open up a can of whoop-ass on your workout!', 'How To ""Fix"" Your Metabolism', 'Alright, now that you know what NOT to do, here’s the good news...', 'Science has proven that there are specific types of exercises that trigger a potent fat-burning effect, which skyrockets your metabolism and boosts your fat-burn for up to 48 hours after your workout is over.', 'These exercises activate more of your muscle fibers, which creates a bigger metabolic boost, demanding more fat to be burned for fuel—so you can burn off the fat and KEEP it off.', 'There’s even more good news...', 'These exercises also stimulate your youth-enhancing hormones so you can slough away old, dead cells — making you look and feel years younger!', 'Listen: getting a lean, defined body with a rock-solid core is easy once you know HOW to trigger the right hormones in your body (and stop the production of the bad hormones that are making you fat and old).', 'On the next page, I’ll show you the specifics behind this fast and easy method.', 'Soon you’ll be able to crank up your metabolism and turn on your youth-enhancing, fat-burning, and lean-muscle building hormones so you can finally shed that stubborn fat without exercising to death or starving yourself.']",1

['Here’s what therapists want you to know about being politically active'],"['You can do anything, but not everything.', 'With everything going on in the United States, chances are you’ve been working to stay informed, and maybe even help out in some ways — both of which can take a lot of mental energy.', 'That might mean going to protests, rallies, and marches, getting involved in local efforts, spending a lot of time on the phone with your representatives, or even just staying up on the constant onslaught of news developments. With SO MUCH going on, it’s easy to get burnt out.', 'The truth is, though, you’re at your most helpful and effective when you know your limits. So, to help you maintain your mental health while being politically active, BuzzFeed Health talked to the following experts:', 'Here’s what they want you to keep in mind.', '1. First, your main goal is to find the balance between taking action and taking enough care of yourself that you’re actually able to work effectively.', 'You can make a difference, yes, but one person can’t do everything at once. So plan to pace yourself and be in it for the long run.', '""It’s not as if, if you don’t do something today and every day, you’ll lose the window of opportunity,"" says Rashad. ""People really get swept up in the momentum, and wanting to do something immediately to counter the feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness. However, it’s not sustainable. It’s like if you’re a runner and enjoy the runner’s high — eventually you’re going to have to rest and sit out a day so your muscles can recover.""', 'So, start learning the answers to these questions: How can you recuperate? What safeguards can you put in place to make this work sustainable in the long run? How can remind yourself of why this is important?', '2. On that note, recognize that self-care doesn’t have to be indulgent and superfluous. Think of it as securing your own oxygen mask before you assist others.', 'If you can’t get on board with doing it for your sake, Bonior says to think about it this way: ""Who would you rather have fighting a battle for you: someone who’s completely demoralized, under-slept, fatigued, not eating well, and stressed to the max [or] someone who is energized and clear-eyed? So if you can’t do it for yourself, do it for the fact that you will absolutely be a better fighter if you take care of yourself.""', 'Self-care looks different for everyone and is never about one specific action — think about it as an ongoing commitment to looking after yourself and making time for things that rejuvenate you. That said, it for sure involves getting enough sleep, eating healthfully, and making sure you have a strong support system around you. But it also might mean carving out time by yourself to decompress with Netflix, play with dogs, go outside for fresh air, or do anything else that makes your heart feel a little lighter.', '3. If you get overwhelmed thinking about what to prioritize, consider where you can actually be most helpful.', 'If you try to decide what’s most important to you or what cause is most urgent, you’ll probably wind up running in circles — because, well, a LOT of things are urgent and important. You likely also care about multiple causes, and it’s not easy to rank them against one another.', 'So, instead, be honest with yourself about what skills you have and the opportunities that there are to help in your area. Are you most comfortable making calls? Are you good at creative efforts to raise awareness? Are you in a place to donate? It might even come down to something as simple as choosing a place to volunteer that’s closest to your apartment, so it’s easier to go more often.', '""It’s knowing where you feel like you’ll have the greater impact within your own small circle of influence,"" says Rashad.', '4. Make specific to-do lists so you can concentrate your energy in productive bursts rather than always worrying about what needs to get done.', 'As with any goal, you need to pick specific, reasonable, and actionable steps, otherwise you won’t get anything done. ""It’s much more effective, especially for self-care and often for the movement, to be able to say, ‘OK, I’m going to spend 15 minutes a day acting on this in this way’ than to think and worry about it all day with little action,"" says Bonior.', 'If you’re not actively involved in a group to help guide your to-do list, you can check out places like 5 Calls, which send out daily digests of actions you can take.', '5. Set boundaries about how and when you keep up with the news.', 'Pretty much the easiest way to stress yourself out right now is keeping up-to-date on everything that’s happening in the news. Obviously, being informed is important and unplugging for even a few hours at a time can feel like burying your head in the sand, but setting up some rules so you’re not constantly exposed to bad, stressful, and even potentially traumatic news is crucial, says Bonior.', 'What works and is actually realistic will be different for everyone, but Bonior says there are a few ways to think about it:', 'These are only a few suggestions, but you get the idea.', '6. On the flip side, avoid news, media, and people who are genuinely hurtful to your well-being.', 'DON’T HATE-READ. It can be so tempting to read comments from trolls, to scroll through that one guy from high school’s Facebook because you can’t believe he’s so bigoted, or to click the link from a radical news site that your friend sent over in disbelief. But 99.9% of the time, it’s not productive and it’s not worth the cost of your mental health.', '""It’s important to recognize that a lot of media and news out there can be hurtful and might not necessarily add to your understanding of an issue,"" says Williams. This is especially true for marginalized or stigmatized groups right now.', '""As a person of color, for example, there are a lot of things being said that we would call microaggressions. I know that I can only deal with so many microaggressions in one day, so I have to pace myself if I’m going to be productive and sane and have a good sense of well-being.""', '7. Remind yourself that it’s OK if your strong emotions die down — in fact, you need to let them.', 'When bad things happen around you, you might find yourself feeling guilty for the moments you feel good — almost like you’re normalizing negative events when you’re not actively sitting in your anger and disgust. But that’s not the case.', '""No one can stay in a state of emotional and physiological arousal indefinitely without burning out,"" says Williams. ""Your body is eventually going to come back down and you may feel complacent at times and that’s OK. If these things are really cherished values, they’re not just going to go away while you think about other things.""', '8. Keep your expectations realistic and don’t rely on immediate results to feel like your work is worthwhile.', 'There might be times when you see that an action you took led to a change — like when Uber CEO Travis Kalanick left President Trump’s economic advisory council after #DeleteUber went viral with customer backlash — but these instances are rare, says Rashad.', '""For the most part, activism doesn’t offer immediate gratification,"" she says. ""And if things aren’t moving at a speed with which you feel content with, it’s very easy to feel impatient and frustrated.""', 'Without that instant gratification to keep you going, it’s really important to always be having conversations about self-care, mental well-being, and the impact of the work you’re doing. Otherwise, you might become cynical, apathetic, and resentful toward the work and the people you’re doing it with, says Rashad.', '9. If this is your first time getting involved in politics in a big way, ease in and focus on educating yourself.', 'For a lot of people — particularly those who were unaware or unaffected by these particular issues — this is going to be the first time they’ve felt compelled to participate in activism. If that’s the case for you, be aware that you’re not going to know everything, and that it’s OK.', '""See yourself as a baby,"" says Rashad. ""Would you expect that baby to run a marathon? No. You start with crawling, then taking your first few steps. So be mindful of taking a stance of humility, be patient with yourself, and expect to make mistakes.""', 'That’s not to say you can’t get involved — you should! Look to the people who have been doing this longer for advice on where and how you can be most helpful. Ask questions! That way you won’t burn yourself out going to every protest and rally that comes through your Facebook invitations.', '10. Know the signs of burnout — and step back if you’re experiencing them.', 'Sometimes you just need a break. Look out for changes in your physical health (are you getting sick more often?), your sleeping and eating patterns, your relationships (have you stopped hanging out with friends or found yourself more irritable around them?), and so on. Also, keep an eye out for any depression and anxiety symptoms in general (you can learn more about those here and here).', 'Another good indicator of burnout is if you’re just feeling, well, defeated. ""If you’re putting in the work and are starting to ask yourself, ‘Well, what’s the point?’ that, to me, is a sign you need to sit out, refresh, and remember why you’re doing this,"" says Rashad.', 'If any of that applies to you, don’t feel guilty about concentrating on yourself for a bit. ""If you need to step away for awhile, don’t interpret that to mean that you don’t care,"" says Williams.', '11. If you’re considering seeing a therapist, put in the effort to find one who gets it.', 'Therapy is never a bad idea, and if you’re someone dedicating a lot of mental energy to political activism, a therapist can be a great sounding board for putting things into perspective and a resource for strategies to help you cope with your emotions day to day, says Williams.', 'That said, not all therapists are equipped to deal with this kind of work (like the issues of marginalized and stigmatized groups) so shop around to find someone you connect well with. Some of that will be trial and error, but always feel free to ask prospective therapists lots of questions — not only about their backgrounds and approach to therapy, but also straight-up whether they feel equipped and open to talking about politics, activism, and issues that pertain to your ethnicity, race, religion, gender, sexuality, etc.', '12. Learn to see positivity and playfulness as an act of resistance.', 'Hold on to the good things in your life and don’t put them on the back burner just because everything else might be demanding more attention.', '""We give the opposition more power when we don’t play, when we don’t have fun, when we don’t find the joy and the happiness in life,"" says Rashad. ""Because then, they’ve taken everything from us. Not only are maybe your rights and life threatened, but your very ability to smile and laugh are also threatened. So don’t give them that power. In the midst of all of this say, ‘I am still committed to playing and to lighter moments and to laughing and smiling and loving.’""']",1

It's a big moment for Apple Inc., which is counting on India's emerging middle class to make up for slowing sales in other markets. But don't bet on the iPhone conquering India, or any other emerging market, just yet."", ""That's because smartphones of all kinds are facing stiff competition from an unlikely new challenger: feature phones. With simple handsets and small screens intended mostly for calls and text messages -- similar to the Nokia or Motorola you probably owned years ago -- a new generation of feature phones is suddenly looking like a threat to Apple and its rivals."", 'For a technology long ago left for dead, feature phones have lately made some impressive gains. After years of almost continuous decline, global shipments have grown for two consecutive quarters. Growth in emerging markets has been especially impressive: In Africa, feature-phone shipments surged 32 percent year-over-year in the second quarter of 2016, compared to a decline of 5.2 percent for smartphones. Expect that trend to continue, for a few reasons.', ""One obvious advantage is price. At the end of 2016, the average global price of a smartphone was $256, compared to $19.30 for a feature phone. In emerging markets, where even educated urbanites typically earn less than $10,000 a year (in India, they average $5,385), that doesn't leave much in the way of consumer choice. But even if a buyer has $256 to spare, the booming secondhand market offers far better options than a smartphone. In Ghana, where I recently spent a few weeks, $256 will buy a used Pentium III desktop computer, a flat-screen monitor, a satellite dish and a decoder box to pirate satellite television broadcasts."", ""Another factor is battery life. In many emerging markets, where electricity service can be intermittent, smartphones that have to be recharged each day can't compete against feature phones that can now go for weeks on a single charge. In West Africa, it's the rare smartphone owner who doesn't also carry a feature phone as a hedge against missing calls and messages due to battery depletion. Equally important, most emerging-market customers prepay for voice and data, making smartphones that passively eat up bandwidth a major inconvenience."", ""Feature-phone makers are also coming up with innovative hardware and services. Chinese-owned iTel has introduced a speech-to-text system that might appeal to hundreds of millions of illiterate or visually impaired buyers with low incomes. India's Zync just introduced six new feature phones with multiple SIM card slots, so customers can take advantage of lower rates when calling phones on the same carrier, or use separate lines for personal and business matters. Reliance Jio Infocomm is said to have a feature phone in the works that enables free calls over LTE networks, much as Skype does, for less than $20."", ""The most important innovation, though, has been the development of mobile-payment systems that require nothing more than text-messaging. A user simply buys credit at a bank or service center, then transfers the money via text to friends or merchants. For the roughly 2 billion people around the world who lack access to basic financial services, that can be a life-changing service. Kenya's M-Pesa, which enables money transfers via SMS, has about 19 million users who exchange more than $140 million daily. In India, the government is fast-tracking such services as a remedy to its demonetization crisis."", ""For smartphone makers, all this spells trouble. Some analysts in India are predicting a slump in smartphone sales and upgrades this year. Leading feature-phone brands have even started introducing cheap smartphones of their own, hoping to convert their considerable market share and brand recognition into upgrades. It's likely that the next major advance in mobile technology won't be dictated by designers in Silicon Valley or Seoul -- but rather by the needs of emerging-market consumers. In that sense, at least, old-school feature phones are starting to look very much like the future.""]",1

However, when she found out the real reason her daughter was perched on the seat of the toilet, she was devastated. ""The moment she told me what she was doing I broke down,"" wrote Stacey. She was practicing for a lockdown drill at her preschool and what you should do if you are stuck in a bathroom. At that moment all innocence of what I thought my three-year-old possessed was gone."" What she is referring to of course is the danger of gun shootings in schools, cinemas, universities, and more recently, nightclubs. News Feed app-facebook Stacey Wehrman Feeley last Wednesday . . I took this picture because initially I thought it was funny. I was going to send it to my husband to show what our mischievous little three-year-old was up to. However, The moment she told me what she was doing I broke down. She was practicing for a lockdown drill at her preschool and what you should do if you are stuck in a bathroom. At that moment all innocense of what I thought my three-year-old possessed was gone. Politicians - take a look. This is your child, you ... r children, your grandchildren, your great grand children and future generations to come. They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions. They are barely 3 and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats. I do not know what will be harder for them? Trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door? No one thinks gun control will be 100% crime control. But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try? Why on earth are there not universal background checks? Where is a universal registration database? Why are high capacity magazines ever permitted to be sold to anyone other than direct to the military? Is that really necessary to protect yourself or hunt for that matter? What about smart guns, where are they? C’mon techies! The 2nd Amendment is a beast to battle and wiping out the right to bear arms is not on the table. Does anyone really think that will be accomplished? Because it won’t. Amended to some extent? Maybe. But how many decades will that take? Where’s the evolution of our so called ""living document"" for this subject matter? A document that originally allowed slavery and prevented women from voting? NRA, are you even trying? Let’s talk mental health. Where is the $500 million that the Obama administration put into the budget for approval...did it go through? Is it being implemented or just sitting there? Where is the access to care for those struggling with mental illness? Politicians, I ask you...how can I help? Banning together, signing petitions, rallying to get your voice heard is good, but is it actually doing anything or just making us feel better about the current situation? We need action. I applaud politicians like Senator Chris Murphy but so many of our elected politicians can’t manage to work together (maybe they shouldn’t be paid for a job they can\'t do...just saying) or since they are in bed with all the wrong people, it is up to us if we want change. I want to know what new smart technology is being built for safer guns, advanced security in public places, databases, traveling care for the mentally ill...anything! Entrepreneurs, innovators, are you there? Can I help? Can I help you make a difference? I want to offer support. I cannot give you techie advice, expertise in healthcare, or financial backing, BUT maybe I can point you in the right direction? Maybe I know someone who knows someone who can help? Incubators, investors...if this issue concerns you, do what you do best and help make change. Can I help? Hold funding competitions, provide think tanks for these very things. Hollywood, the PSA’s are good, but not good enough. Eventually they disappear and are forgotten. I am not pretending to have all the answers or even a shred of them, but unless you want your children standing on top of a toilet, we need to do something! As a US mum, Stacey used the image as an emotive part of an open letter to her government and the National Rifle Association (NRA), pleading for a change, for gun control, for better mental health services – for something that will stop the need to school three-year old’s on what to do if a shooter enters their school. ""Politicians – take a look,"" she wrote. ""This is your child, your children, your grandchildren, your great grandchildren and future generations to come. They will live their lives and grow up in this world based on your decisions. They are barely 3 and they will hide in bathroom stalls standing on top of toilet seats. I do not know what will be harder for them? Trying to remain quiet for an extended amount of time or trying to keep their balance without letting a foot slip below the stall door?"" In her post Stacey admits she doesn’t claim to know what the answer is to the problem, but she wants people to try something new – to feel as passionate as she does to sit up and make this issue a priority. ""No one thinks gun control will be 100% crime control. But maybe, just maybe, it helps 1% or 2% or 50%? Who knows unless we try? Why on earth are there not universal background checks? Where is a universal registration database? Why are high capacity magazines ever permitted to be sold to anyone other than direct to the military?

""Where is the $500 million that the Obama administration put into the budget for approval...did it go through? Is it being implemented or just sitting there? Where is the access to care for those struggling with mental illness? Politicians, I ask you...how can I help?"" Many mums in America echo Stacey’s worries, and a movement, previously called One Million Moms for Gun Control, renamed as Moms Demand Action , is showing he power of a collective voice of mothers who want to protect their children. Set up by mum Shannon Watts, the movement went from hundreds of followers to some 3.5 million, all committed to fighting the NRA on its gun policies. As mums, the image of Stacey’s child standing on that toilet squeezes our hearts. We can only imagine her fear and the fear of millions of mums across the US – and we hope change happens for these families, and soon.']",1

So useless, in fact, that the American College of Physicians, the largest medical specialty organization in the country, recommends that doctors stop performing it.', ""It's called the bimanual pelvic exam. To get it done, the patient lays on the medical exam bed, naked from the waist down and feet in stirrups. Then the doctor puts gloved, lubricated fingers inside the vagina while simultaneously pressing down on the patient's belly with his or her other hand."", 'The point of the exam is to try to push both sets of fingers together to meet somewhere in the middle, which allows doctors to evaluate the size and position of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. (Ow.)', '""It\'s an inherently limited exam, and in asymptomatic people it just doesn\'t provide any benefit,"" Dr. Molly Cooke, ACP’s Immediate Past President and a member of ACP’s Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee, told the Huffington Post. ""Since the mid-\'90s, there have been studies that show the accuracy of the bimanual exam in diagnosing ovarian cancer is extremely poor.""', 'So why are doctors still performing it? People hate change, Cooke explained. Historically, doctors used the bimanual exam to screen for benign lesions and ovarian cancer -- a particularly aggressive form of cancer that is often fatal if it spreads.', 'But ovarian cancer itself is extremely rare, and the women who are most at risk for developing the disease either have the BRCA gene mutation or have undergone ovary-stimulating fertility treatments in the past, said Cooke. Besides, the most reliable way to diagnose ovarian cancer is through an ultrasound or blood test -- not a pelvic exam.', '""The data doesn\'t support doing this element of the checkup, but a lot of doctors are still doing it,"" said Cooke. ""My own gynecologist still does it!""', 'The ACP conducted a systematic review of studies that date back to 1946 and summarized the findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine, along with a recommendation against the pelvic exam for healthy, asymptomatic and non-pregnant adult women.', 'This is a sample of what the study review found:', ""Bimanual exams on their own aren't enough to detect cancer. In a large randomized controlled trial involving 78,000 women over a long period of time, researchers eventually stopped performing bimanual pelvic exams five years into the study for precisely this reason."", 'In eight surveys involving 4,567 women, participants reported feeling pain or discomfort during the pelvic exam (results ranged from 11 percent to 60 percent).', 'In seven studies involving 10,702 women, participants reported feeling fear, embarrassment or anxiety (results ranged from 10 percent to 80 percent).', 'Five studies found that women who felt pain and discomfort during the exam were less likely to return to the doctor for a follow up visit.', ""There's a dearth of studies on the subject of unnecessary surgeries, except one that indirectly showed pelvic exams led to 1.5 percent of women having unnecessary surgery (29 out of 2,000 people)."", ""Several studies found that women who had experienced sexual violence in the past also reported feeling fear, anxiety, embarrassment, pain and discomfort during a pelvic exam at higher numbers compared with women who weren't victims of abuse."", 'In an editorial that accompanied the recommendation, Dr. George F. Sawaya and Dr. Vanessa Jacoby of UC San Francisco wrote that the exam has evolved from evidence-based practice into an unquestioned ""ritual"" that may in fact harm women more than help them. The harms range from mere discomfort to all the way to unnecessary surgery for otherwise benign growths.', ""While it's unclear how many undergo an unnecessary surgery, the New York Times reported in 2013 that U.S. rates of ovarian cystectomy and hysterectomy are more than twice as high as some European countries -- perhaps because other countries only perform the bimanual exam on women with other symptoms."", ""Even if the ACP's recommendation doesn't result in systemic change for gynecologists across the U.S., it should challenge proponents of the exam to come up with clear reasons to continue conducting them, Sawaya and Jacoby wrote."", '""The pelvic examination has held a prominent place in women’s health for many decades and has come to be more of a ritual than an evidence-based practice,"" they wrote. ""With the current state of evidence, clinicians who continue to offer the examination should at least be cognizant about the uncertainty of its benefits and its potential to cause harm through false-positive testing and the cascade of events it prompts.""', ""Dr. Ranit Mishori, an associate professor of family medicine at Georgetown School of Medicine and a practicing family physician, was not involved with the ACP's decision, but praised its recommendation and said it was long overdue."", '""Many of us, myself included, have already stopped doing these pelvic exams,"" Mishori told HuffPost. ""It\'s going to make some waves, which is a good thing, but I think it\'s important as part of a general trend to question rituals that may not have much value.""', 'Other rituals that need to be questioned: the general annual physical itself, according to Mishori. Studies have shown that the appointments may not have much value, especially for people with no symptoms or high risks.', '""Years ago, when I went to med school, we were taught the pelvic exam screened for STDS, but we now know we can screen for those things with a urine test,"" Mishori said. ""We once thought a pelvic exam was needed before prescribing birth control, but now we know it\'s completely unnecessary.""', '""We need to recognize that a lot of things we do during the annual physical is irrelevant,"" Mishori added. ""Talking reproductive health, there should be a cervical screening every three to five years, and that\'s it -- nothing else,"" she concluded.', 'Instead of taking time for the bimanual exams, gynecologists and primary care physicians would do well to devote two-thirds or even three-quarters of the annual visit to simple conversation, Cooke recommended.', '""The visit should spend a significant amount of time making sure our patient isn\'t smoking or drinking too much,"" said Cooke. ""Does she feel safe in her community, her home and her relationship? Just really connect with that patient as a person."" Lifestyle screening, which includes questions about mental health, are much more likely to benefit women more than the bimanual exam, said Cooke.', ""But of course, just because doctors should do away with bimanual screening for most asymptomatic patients, some women may still have to take their panties off -- even if they fit the bill. Pap smears are still effective parts of the preventive exam for women ages 21 to 65, said Cooke, although the test doesn't need to be done every year."", ""Cooke anticipates at least some blowback about the ACP's recommendation; for instance, some doctors have expressed fear that patients won't come in for exams at all. She also brought up the possibility that patients might suspect their doctor is short-changing them a bimanual exam on the directive of an insurance company. That's why the ACP wants to get the word out about the recommendation not just to physicians, but to patients, too."", ""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misspelled Dr. Ranit Mishori's name. Additionally, it inaccurately described one aspect of the bimanual exam. We regret the errors.""]",1

I know that when I graduated from college and my student loans kicked in, the payments had me eating Ramen noodles and reading books by candlelight to save money until I could find a roommate.

It's worth eating Ramen to get that free money. Beyond that or if you don't have a match, then it comes down to where your money will work hardest for you. If your student loan interest rates are 6% or less, you're still likely better off investing that money aggressively for the long-term rather than paying off your loans earlier. Even just eking out $50 per paycheck to save for retirement can make a six-figure difference in your ending balance down the road... as long as you're not also making the second mistake."", ""2. Investing too conservatively. Our research shows that Millennials are less likely to have general investment knowledge compared to older generations. Other research has shown that Millennials are more likely to call themselves conservative investors despite having a longer timeline than their older Gen X and Baby Boomer counterparts.

Living in a fancy place with no financial foundation. This is one of the bigger financial mistakes I personally made in my 20's. After living in a dumpy apartment my senior year of college that had roaches and traffic noise that literally kept me up at night, I couldn't wait to upgrade to a luxury apartment with all the accoutrements. About six weeks into my year-long lease though, I was rethinking that decision (see above regarding Ramen and candlelight). Because I was just starting out in my career with a boatload of student loans, no emergency fund and some credit card debt to boot, I was in a precarious financial situation and was living way out of my league."", ""There's definitely something to be said for living in a comfortable, bug-free home where you can get a decent night's sleep, but jumping straight to the nicest community in town was a mistake. As soon as I could get out of that lease, I found a smaller place that was much more in line with my starting income. When looking for a place to live, decide which things you can and can't live without in order to meet other financial goals in the meantime. If housing costs are eating up more than 50% of your income, it's too expensive. Build up your emergency fund before you choose housing that may be a financial stretch for you."", ""5.

And as my husband and I wait, month after month, to conceive our first child, sometimes I confess that I wonder if I did miss out. But then I remember all the wisdom and experience I'll bring to motherhood, as delayed as it may be, that I wouldn't have if I'd taken that step earlier."", ""It's a mixed message, one that author Elizabeth Gilbert describes as sometimes becoming paralyzed by indecision.

The antidote to this extends far beyond your personal finances, but as it relates to your money and avoiding making doozie mistakes, I'll just offer this: when making financial decisions for yourself, from something as small as buying that Starbucks on the way to work to as big as booking a trip to the other side of the world, stop and ask yourself if you would be making this choice if you couldn't share it on social media."", ""Finding a way to overcome these five situations could be more about making a mind shift and less about a lack of financial resources.

But at least we have Wiley. Even within grime’s playpen of extroverts, he is a wildcard, a high priest of obstreperousness who seemingly lives to upset applecarts – playing games with persona and reality, rampaging through the music industry, pouring out an endless stream of consciousness through his lyrics but also whatever social media platform takes his fancy at the time. He’s constantly walked a line between gangster coldness and a childlike openness, and between truly avant garde brilliance and shameless pop ambition.', 'He’s picked fights with almost everyone in grime, from the most spectacularly petty to the deadly serious, yet somehow as he matures (he just turned 37) he manages to retain his place as the scene’s patriarch. He should probably be a bigger national and international star than he is, but the way he has constantly splurged out his work, self-sabotaged and evaded expectation means that he displays the polar opposite of the gimlet-eyed ambition of his one-time brother-in-arms Dizzee Rascal, and can be very confusing to all but the most avid observer. Nonetheless, he has just released one of the best and most focused albums in his career, The Godfather, and against all odds seems as energised as he’s ever been.', 'Trying to do a ""best of Wiley"" is a fool’s errand, as aside from the vastness of his official and unofficial work, his moments of greatness are as likely to be a Twitter outburst as a lyric, and some high points are often entirely dependent on understanding the context within the soap opera of his life and the grime scene. However, here are five moments out of many where he shines bright, each of which offers a window into the world of one of the truest individualists of the modern musical world.', '1. Back and forth with Eksman', 'It’s worth having a dig through YouTube for recordings of Wiley MCing on drum’n’bass DJ sets in the 90s for two main reasons. First, as an indicator of just how long he’s been honing his craft: the first ones are from 1996, and already on this rapid-fire to-and-fro with drum’n’bass mainstay Eksman from 1998 his flow and enunciation are impeccable. And, second, to understand that his roots are in the rave. This was his school, where he learned the weird and extreme sonorities that would feed into his groundbreaking electronic productions, and you can also see the hyperspeed patter of drum’n’bass as the launching of the relentless stream of verbal momentum that has characterised his entire life since. Although his style is pretty much standard for the time, and the subject matter is hype, threats and boasts, you can already see his leftfield inventiveness in throwaway oddities like ""wipe my feet on your face just like a doormat, I’m coming through the catflap"". ', '2. Working with Dizzee', 'Where it all coalesced. Having earned his stripes in drum’n’bass and achieved stardom in UK garage as part of Pay As U Go Cartel, the years 2001 and 2002 saw Wiley find his voice in all respects. The eerie ""Eskibeat"" instrumentals he was selling by the tens of thousands on white label 12in singles, and the varied MC talent of the original lineup of Roll Deep Crew were among grime’s defining sounds. But it was his to-and-fro with his young friend and protege Dizzee Rascal on rave sets and tapes that probably did more than anything else to signal to the world that something new had arrived. Their falling out – apparently over hot-headedness and petty crew politics that led to Dizzee’s stabbing in Ayia Napa – is one of the great creative tragedies of modern pop.', '3. Sorry Sorry Pardon What', 'In a typical flurry of activity, Wiley released five album-length Tunnel Vision mixtapes in just six months at the end of 2006. This one opened the last, as well as forming a B-side to an official single release later in the year. In a multilayered bit of self-referentiality, he samples Dizzee’s vocaling of his own 2003 Ice Rink instrumental – which itself was possibly the most perfect expression of the deep emotional complexity of his Eskibeat style – then rides the rhythm himself on some of the most cantankerous, I’ll-fight-the-lot-of-yer form of his life. Notable for world-class language mangling like ""blood, you’re the one who got smacked in the grilliam"".', '4. Step Three Freestyle', 'And, talking of language mangling, here’s one of those classic moments where Wiley’s musical vividness of expression just seems to spill over, beyond the meaning his words are capable of containing. At the same time as he was having his biggest major label pop hit, Heatwave, he was also returning to the Big Dada label to say: ""Let’s go and make magic / I couldn’t quit grime if I wanted to / it’s been a long time, I’m an addict / for me it’s just a habit / and this fire in my belly right now / rudeboy you have never had it / had it, had it, never had it / had it, had it, never had it / never never never never never never never never."" It’s that rave MC glossolalia – also constantly resurgent in his tendency to burst out with ""budududu badadadada"" as part of lines – that will never leave him and which keeps the momentum going within the track and his career.', '5. Bring Them All/Holy Grime ft Devlin', 'And here he is, in 2016, with a fellow rapper with whom who he’s fought and bickered over the years. For every time Wiley has wistfully looked to the big money of US success, or found himself at the top of the British charts with a dance track by accident or design, he can’t stop himself falling back to the pleasures of just MCing over a soundsystem-testing beat. As ever, he’s commentating on his own life and on anything that falls into his field of vision, prodding, testing, trying ideas out. For all that grime, at the start of the century, seemed like an explosion that couldn’t possibly do anything other than burn out, a decade and a half on, Wiley and his fellow elder statesmen Skepta, JME, P Money, Ghetts, Devlin, Flowdan and a whole lot of others are doing a shockingly good job of making it look like there’s life in the old dog yet.']",1

Last year, the company sold 2,000 supercars to lucky buyers, but with the investment, it hopes to expand this number to 5,000. To get there, McLaren will divert most of the money into producing new powertrains and designing new carbon fiber structures. Currently, most of McLaren's lineup features similar carbon fiber and aluminum frames powered by an impressive 3.8-liter V8. We can be sure that the next engine will be smaller and come with turbochargers."", ""Flewitt didn't give any details on the engine that will power the next generation of McLarens, but he confirmed that we could expect to see hybrid drivetrains coming. At least one new car featuring the new toys will come out by the end of the decade with all 15 hitting showrooms by 2022. At least one of these cars will be the all electric McLaren we keep hearing about and that Ferrari refuses to compete with. Part of the reason for the new technology, aside from pursuing better lap times and beating Ferrari, is because of the increasingly tight fuel restrictions on the cars. We may hate on companies for downsizing their engines, but the reality is that Ferrari and McLaren don't have a choice.

"[""The baffling reason many millennials don't eat cereal""]","['Few things are as painless to prepare as cereal. Making it requires little more than pouring something (a cereal of your choice) into a bowl and then pouring something else (a milk of your choice) into the same bowl. Eating it requires little more than a spoon and your mouth. The food, which Americans still buy $10 billion of annually, has thrived over the decades, at least in part, because of this very quality: its convenience.', ""And yet, for today's youth, cereal isn't easy enough."", 'On Monday, the New York Times published a story about the breakfast favorite, and the most disconcerting part was this:', 'Almost 40 percent of the millennials surveyed by Mintel for its 2015 report said cereal was an inconvenient breakfast choice because they had to clean up after eating it.', 'The industry, the piece explained, is struggling — sales have tumbled by almost 30 percent over the past 15 years, and the future remains uncertain. And the reasons are largely those one would expect: Many people are eating breakfast away from the home, choosing breakfast sandwiches and yogurt instead of more traditional morning staples. Many others, meanwhile, too busy to pay attention to their stomachs, are eating breakfast not at all.', ""But there is another thing happening, which should scare cereal makers — and, really, anyone who has a stake in this country's future — more: A large contingent of millennials are uninterested in breakfast cereal because eating it means using a bowl, and bowls don't clean themselves (or get tossed in the garbage). Bowls, kids these days groan, have to be cleaned."", ""Cereal isn't the only food suffering from a national trend toward laziness. Coffee has suffered a similar fate. Despite talk of a third wave of coffee, which values quality above all else, and basks in artisanal rather than effortless methods of preparation, Americans still covet convenience above all else."", '""Convenience is the one thing that’s really changing trends these days,"" Howard Telford, an industry analyst at market research firm Euromonitor, said last year.', ""Less than 10 percent of the coffee beans Americans buy are fresh whole beans. And ground coffee isn't just outpacing whole bean coffee — it's increasing its lead, each and every year."", ""The rise of coffee pods, which come pre-ground and produce a cup of brown caffeinated water with the push of a button, is further evidence of the country's desire for convenience. Sales of coffee pods grew by 138,324 percent between 2004 and 2014, according to data from Euromonitor."", 'The popularity of delivery, meanwhile, speaks to the same tendency toward convenience. Roughly 15 percent of restaurant meals are delivered today, according to data from Technomic. But among millennials the percentage is higher: more like 20 percent.', ""The reason why convenience is increasingly important isn't merely because people are lazy — many actually need it."", ""Families are working more than ever. Almost two-thirds of households are supported by two working parents today, according to the latest government data, which is the highest reading on record. The less time families have to prepare food or sit down at restaurants, the more convenience hovers over decisions about food, especially when there is an option that is easier. Dinner, which isn't being cooked at home as often as it used to, is among the trend's many casualties. Less than 60 percent of suppers served at home were actually cooked at home last year. Only 30 years ago, the percentage was closer to 75 percent."", 'But there is something different about the backlash against cereal bowls, something more foundational about it that seems to speak to a greater truth about American households today.', 'A 2014 national survey, conducted by Braun Research, found that 82 percent of parents said they were asked to do chores as children. But when they were asked if they required their children to do chores, only 28 percent of them said yes.', 'And this generational shift in how families raise their kids seems to be turning even the most mundane of responsibilities, like doing the dishes, into unthinkable nuisances.', ""Ultimately, cereal makers will settle on a strategy for reversing the industry's downward trend. Among the likeliest routes are embracing the fact that many people are eating the food at times other than breakfast, often as a snack, channeling the food's nostalgic quality, which helped buoy the industry for years, and shifting to portable containers, which nearly half of millennials prefer, according to Mintel."", ""No matter the result, America's youth might have to reckon with the consequences of an age in which it's no longer worth eating a food when it means having to clean a plate.

The increase corresponded to a reduction of 2 percent in low birth weight.', ""Birth weight is not only connected to babies' health through infancy and childhood, but also to their educational and financial prospects in the rest of their lives. The new paper suggests that the minimum wage could have lasting effects not only on today's economy, but on the next generation of Americans as well."", 'Low birth weight is "" a very serious outcome in terms of infant health and even potentially lifetime circumstances,"" said Robert Kaestner, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago and one of the authors of the paper. ""Reducing the rate of low birth weight by 3 percent or 5 percent is a nontrivial feat.""', 'Kaestner and his colleagues, George Wehby of the University of Iowa and Dhaval Dave of Bentley University in Massachusetts, used federal data from birth certificates to compare birth weights in states where the minimum wage increased to birth weights in states that did not. The vital records include data on every birth in the country, and the researchers analyzed all of them between 1989 and 2012.', 'There are other factors besides the minimum wage that affect average birth weights in a state, but Wehby, Dave and Kaestner found that in states where the minimum increased, birth weights were not significantly different before the increase from birth weights in states without an increase or where there was an increase only several years later. The similarities among states in the periods before increases in the minimum suggest that any differences in birth weight afterward are a result of the minimum wage, not of other factors.', 'The results show that an increase in the minimum wage benefited expecting mothers of all kinds, but women who were more likely to earn the minimum wage benefited more, and so did their children.', 'In terms of the reduction in low birth weight, babies born to mothers of color benefited about three times as much from increases in the minimum wage as babies born to white mothers.', 'Young women with just a high-school diploma were another group whose newborns were particularly helped by the minimum wage. Better educated women were less likely to earn the minimum wage anyway. The same also appeared to be true of older women without a good education, who presumably had had more time to gain experience on the job and were making more money.', 'Women without even a diploma also benefited, but less so. Many of them might have had a hard time getting even a minimum-wage job. To the extent that employers hired fewer workers due to the increased cost of labor in states that increased the minimum wage, changes in the minimum might have reduced the incomes of some of these women as well.', ""Wehby, Dave and Kaestner's results accord with previous research on the relationship between income and birth weight among women at the margins of the economy, including a Wehby, Dave and Kaestner's results accord with previous research on the relationship between income and birth weight among women at the margins of the economy, including a study on the Earned Income Tax Credit published in 2010.""]",1

We\'re the bad guys.""', ""The tone is sly, the exchange is knowing, and the faux-naifery is at full throttle. Pilkey, rather than imply that his characters are wrong in their beliefs, doubles down on their being right.

One afternoon at a doctor’s appointment, her doctor moved her large purse to another chair and remarked how heavy it was. ""You must be very rich,"" he said to her. ""I am,"" she said affirmatively.', 'My grandparents lived modestly, still in the narrow two-bedroom rowhouse where she’d raised her family since her husband returned from World War II. They didn’t travel, eat lavish meals or shop at the finest department stores. Neither had careers that followed their passions. (She would have been an amazing teacher, he an exquisite artist.) Yet, she genuinely considered herself rich because she had a husband, children and grandchildren whom she adored.', 'My grandmother knew what Harvard researchers have since confirmed: Relationships are the key to a happy life.', '[Your relationships are just as important to your health as diet and exercise]', 'Robert Waldinger, a Harvard psychiatrist, took over the more than 75-year-long Grant Study in 2003, becoming the fourth person to run it. He recently gave a TedTalk on it that has been viewed more than 6.5 million times since November 2015.', 'Waldinger felt it was important to do it. The federal government had spent millions on the study for decades, but everyday taxpayers didn’t really know what was discovered.', 'And there’s certainly an appetite for knowing what makes a good life.', 'The longest study of human development, the ongoing Grant Study is a decades-long project that began following the lives of Harvard University men selected in 1938 – among them President John F. Kennedy and former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee – and tracked every aspect of their lives. In the 1970s, that study teamed with a similar one that had been following a group of young men from inner-city Boston tenements since the 1940s. That has allowed them to contrast social status and upbringings, but otherwise everyone in the study is a white male.', 'Periodically the men’s physical and emotional well-being are assessed. Recently that has included genetic testing. Many conclusions have been gleaned from monitoring these lives from young adult through old age, but to Waldinger there’s one clear takeaway: The happiest and healthiest participants in both groups were the ones who maintained close, intimate relationships.', 'Waldinger, an Iowan who went to Harvard for undergrad and never left, has known the answer for years. He’s studied relationships his whole career and brought that perspective with him to the study. His first grant proposal as director was to invite the wives of the men – those still alive then in their 80s – to examine the impact of marriages on physical health.', 'Those satisfied in their relationships were happier and healthier. It was that simple.', '""People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely,"" Waldinger said in his TedTalk.

Casual relationships, like the ones forged on social media won’t do; neither will contentious ones like an abusive marriage or an unreliable friend.', 'Most of the men in the late 1930s believed career achievement equated a good life.

No, there’s no plan for a fourth Iron Man."" That was the rather blunt response that Downey Jr. gave to Variety recently when asked about the potential future of the successful comic book franchise. The actor is currently up at the Toronto International Film Festival promoting his new movieThe Judge, which is the actor\'s first dramatic film since 2009\'sThe SoloistAnyone who is in any way familiar with the history of contract talks between Robert Downey Jr. and Marvel shouldn\'t be too surprised that the star\'s stay as Tony Stark may not extend pastThe Avengers 3. As, statistically, the biggest draw in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Downey Jr. has long had an upper hand in negotiations with the company - to the point where he even got them to pay him $50 million for his work inThe Avengers- a figure that he himself has confirmed. Because of these hardball tactics, there was a time when there was a possibility that the Oscar-nominee wouldn\'t be inThe Avengers 2- and writer/director Joss Whedon even said that he wouldn\'t do the movie without him. It\'s not hard to see why Marvel might not be eager to jump back into contract extension conversations for anIron Man 4Furthermore, while Downey Jr. was undoubtedly an extremely important player in the establishment of Marvel Studios as a blockbuster success, the company has been doing just fine making movies without him recently. James Gunn\'sGuardians of the Galaxyand Joe and Anthony Russo\'sCaptain America: The Winter Soldiercurrently stand as the two biggest domestic releases of the year, and both achieved their positions without Iron Man\'s presence (provided you ignore the blink-and-you-miss-it photo of the character in the latter film). It\'s true that Downey Jr. has appeared in all of the studio\'s top four titles, but the comic book giant is learning how to achieve big things without the star\'s presence.So, ifIron Man 4isn\'t part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\'s Phase Three plans - what projects are coming up? In addition to Peyton Reed\'sAnt-Man, the Russos\'Captain America 3, and Gunn\'sGuardians of the Galaxy 2, they are also working on seven untitled projects that will be coming out between now and 2019 - three of which are all but confirmed to beDoctor Strange,Thor 3,andThe Avengers 3.

The Silicon Valley company constantly tweaks its algorithms, and in June it made a sweeping set of changes that would rank publisher content in general less favorably in the news feed.', 'Thursday’s algorithm change is not the first time Facebook has cracked down on clickbait. In 2014, the company said it was moving to feature spamlike articles less prominently by looking at other factors, such as if a user has ""liked"" and then quickly ""unliked"" a story that appeared in the feed. Other factors, such as how much time people spent reading an article after clicking on it, also contributed to Facebook’s clickbait calculations.', 'Thursday’s announcement goes a step further. Facebook spent months classifying phrases commonly used in clickbait headlines. Mr. Mosseri offered examples like ""The Dog Barked at the Deliveryman and His Reaction Was Priceless,"" or ""When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions and Saw THIS ...

['How a young woman died after falling down on the beach'],"[""A healthy 20-year-old woman was running on a beach with friends when she fell on the wet sand. After briefly standing, she fell again, and within 30 seconds, became unresponsive. Her lips turned blue and she started gasping for breath. Her friends quickly called the paramedics and performed CPR, but it didn't help, according to a recent report of her case."", 'She was pronounced dead within half an hour. What happened?', ""According to the case report, the impact of the woman's body on the sand when she fell was enough to prompt a rare heart condition called commotio cordis, in which the heart is jolted into an arrhythmic pattern, after which it stops altogether. The report was published online Nov. 1 in the Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine."", ""Commotio cordis is caused by an abrupt blow to the heart, usually by something small like a baseball, that strikes at a very specific time, said Dr. Emile Daoud, professor of internal medicine at the Ohio State University Medical Center, who was not involved in the woman's case. It typically strikes kids who have less muscle and fat than adults to shield their hearts. [9 Oddest Medical Cases]"", 'The condition results from a blow during the brief period of time after the heart contracts, when the organ is recharging itself. During this time -- a span of a few milliseconds -- one part of the heart has repolarized and is ready to fire, while the rest of the organ is not yet ready. If an abrupt, focused blow strikes during this time, it can cause part of the heart to fire, but not the rest of it, Daoud said.', '""This throws everything into chaos,"" Daoud told LiveScience. The heart goes into ventricular fibrillation, a name for the uncoordinated contraction of the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart), and the patient usually dies from cardiac arrest.', 'Commotio cordis is quite rare, killing between two to four people yearly in the United States, according to the study. But once it strikes, it is deadly -- only about 10 percent of U.S. patients have been resuscitated and survived.', 'Due to its rarity, Daoud said he has not seen a case of commotio cordis, but has colleagues who have.', 'Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, has not seen patients with the condition and hasn\'t heard of colleagues seeing it, either, though she has read about it. ""It\'s certainly scary -- these people are otherwise healthy with no underlying conditions,"" she told LiveScience.', ""But this case was even more unusual and rare than most. The patient was an adult, but the average age of people the condition strikes is 14. She was also overweight, whereas the condition tends to strike lean people -- it's thought that fat helps shield the heart from this type of blow, the researchers said."", ""Moreover, the woman fell on sand, which wouldn't be expected to cause this condition, Daoud said. Typically a very focused, hard impact is necessary, like a blow from a speeding baseball."", 'Even soccer balls and footballs have only rarely been found to lead to commotio cordis, Daoud added.']",1

['Will Doctor Strange Include Another Major Villain From The Comics?'],"['Will Doctor Strange Include Another Major Villain From The Comics? By Adam Holmes Warning: possible spoilers for Doctor Strange are ahead! Stephen Strange\'s debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe this fall is, of course, also including a few of his adversaries from the comics. We\'ve known for a while that Mads Mikkelsen will be playing Doctor Strange\'s main antagonist, Kaecilius, one of the Ancient One\'s former followers. Then there\'s Chiwetel Ejiofor\'s Mordo, who, although an ally in this movie, could follow in his comic book counterpart\'s footsteps and become Stephen\'s arch-nemesis in the future. Now there\'s a possible hint of an even bigger villain (figuratively and literally) appearing who fans have speculated about, but has never been officially confirmed: Dormammu. Following the report that Rick and Morty creator Dan Harmon is writing some scenes for Doctor Strange, Reddit user ""Bifrost51"" went back to watch the San Diego Comic-Con episode of the Harmontown podcast. One of the moments showed a list of document on Harmon\'s computer, and one of the files was named ""Strange Confronts Dormammu."" Keep in mind that this by no means official. Assuming the screenshot is real, it could just be Harmon screwing around with everyone watching. Maybe he just gave a document that title to throw fans off track about what\'s really happening. However, if this document is the real deal, this means that Dormammu has been secretly been set up as major threat in Doctor Strange. To what extent remains to be seen. Dormammu is without a doubt Doctor Strange\'s most powerful recurring enemy in the comics. Thanks to Strange helping Dormammu in their first encounter when his minions, the Mindless Ones, went out of control, the ruler of the Dark Dimension agreed never to enter the ""Earth realm"" again. Unfortunately, even with that restriction, Dormammu hasn\'t stopped trying to invade our plane of existence in other ways. There could be a similar setup in Doctor Strange, as some have speculated that the weird blackening around Kaecilius\' eyes might be a sign of Dormammu\'s influence or possession over him. Perhaps in order to accomplish his goals, Kaecilius has resorted to harnessing some kind of dark magic, i.e. Dormammu\'s power. That in turn provides a conduit for Dormammu to initiate his own plans on Earth, since he can\'t do anything by himself directly. Obviously this all just guesswork, but if Dormmamu does appear in Doctor Strange, it\'s important he\'s adapted correctly. This is not the kind of villain who you use for one movie and then kill by the end of the story. Not only would he make a great enemy for Doctor Strange 2, but we don\'t want a repeat of Galactus in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer or Parallax in Green Lantern. Either way, we only have a little over two months until we learn whether Dormammu\'s inclusion is legitimate or not. Doctor Strange will work its magic in theaters on November 4. Let us know if you\'d enjoy a possible Dormammu appearance in the comments below. Blended From Around The Web Comments Facebook', 'Back to top']",1

['Can the United Kingdom government legally disregard a vote for Brexit?'],"['What follows any What follows any referendum vote next week for the United Kingdom to leave the EU? From a legal perspective, the immediate consequence is simple: nothing will happen.', 'The relevant legislation did not provide for the referendum result to have any formal trigger effect. The referendum is advisory rather than mandatory. The 2011 referendum on electoral reform did have an obligation on the government to legislate in the event of a ""yes"" vote (the vote was ""no"" so this did not matter). But no such provision was included in the EU referendum legislation.', 'What happens next in the event of a vote to leave is therefore a matter of politics not law. It will come down to what is politically expedient and practicable. The UK government could seek to ignore such a vote; to explain it away and characterise it in terms that it has no credibility or binding effect (low turnout may be such an excuse). Or they could say it is now a matter for parliament, and then endeavour to win the parliamentary vote. Or ministers could try to re-negotiate another deal and put that to another referendum. There is, after all, a tradition of EU member states repeating referendums on EU-related matters until voters eventually vote the ""right"" way.', 'What matters in law is when and whether the government invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. This is the significant ""red button"". Once the Article 50 process is commenced then Brexit does become a matter of law, and quite an urgent one. It would appear this process is (and is intended to be) irreversible and irrevocable once it starts. But invoking Article 50 is a legally distinct step from the referendum result — it is not an obligation.', 'Article 50 in full contains the following provisions:', '1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. 2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. 3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period. 4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it. A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 5. If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.', 'There are three points of interest here in respect of any withdrawal from the EU by the UK.', 'First, it is a matter for a member state’s ""own constitutional requirements"" as to how it decides to withdraw. The manner is not prescribed: so it can be a referendum, or a parliamentary vote, or some other means. In the UK, it would seem that some form of parliamentary approval would be required — perhaps a motion or resolution rather than a statute. The position, however, is not clear and the UK government has so far been coy about being specific.', 'Second, the crucial act is the notification by the member state under Article 50(2). That is the event which commences the formal process, which is then intended to be effected by negotiation and agreement. There is no (express) provision for a member state to withdraw from the process or revoke the notification. Once the notification is given, the member state and the EU are stuck with it.', 'And third, there is a hard deadline of two years. This is what gives real force to Article 50. The alternative would be the prospect of a never ending story of rounds of discussions and negotiations. Once notification is given, then the member state is out in two years, unless this period is extended by unanimous agreement. It is possible that such unanimity may be forthcoming – but this would be outside of the power of the member state. Once the button is pushed, the countdown cannot just be switched off by a member state saying it has changed its mind, or by claiming that the Article 50 notification was just a negotiation tactic all along. That will not wash.', 'This said, what is created by international agreement can be undone by international agreement. Practical politicians in Brussels may come up with some muddling fudge which holds off the two year deadline. Or there could be some new treaty amendment. These conveniences cannot, however, be counted on. The assumption must be that once the Article 50 notification is given, the UK will be out of the EU in two years or less.', 'What happens between a Leave vote and any Article 50 notification will be driven by politics. The conventional wisdom is that, of course, a vote for Brexit would have to be respected. (This is the same conventional wisdom which told us that, of course, Jeremy Corbyn would not be elected Labour leader and that, of course, Donald Trump would not be the Republican nominee.) To not do so would be ""unthinkable"" and ""political suicide"" and so on.', 'And if there is a parliamentary vote before any Article 50 notification then there is the potential irony of those seeking to defend parliamentary sovereignty demanding that an extra-parliamentary referendum be treated as binding. But it must be right that the final decision is made by parliament, regardless of what the supposed defenders of parliamentary sovereignty say.', 'One suspects that no great thought went into the practical and legal consequences of a Leave vote because it was expected that the vote would be, of course, for the UK to remain. That may well be the result: nobody knows what will happen next week, and only a fool relies on opinion polls. And referendums do tend to support the status quo (though not always). It could turn out that worrying about what happens if there is a vote for Brexit is misplaced.', 'What is certain is that if there an Article 50 notification then there will be immense legal work to be done. Over 40 years of law-making — tens of thousands of legal instruments — will have to be unpicked and either placed on some fresh basis or discarded with thought as to the consequences. The UK government has depended since 1972 — indeed it has over-depended — on it being easy to implement law derived from the EU. The task of repeal and replacement will take years to complete, if it is ever completed. Even if the key legislation — especially the European Communities Act 1972 — is repealed there will have to be holding and saving legislation for at least a political generation.', 'A vote for Brexit will not be determinative of whether the UK will leave the EU. That potential outcome comes down to the political decisions which then follow before the Article 50 notification. The policy of the government (if not of all of its ministers) is to remain in the EU. The UK government may thereby seek to put off the Article 50 notification, regardless of political pressure and conventional wisdom.', 'There may already be plans in place to slow things down and to put off any substantive decision until after summer. In turn, those supporting Brexit cannot simply celebrate a vote for leave as a job done — for them the real political work begins in getting the government to make the Article 50 notification as soon as possible with no further preconditions.', 'On the day after a vote for Brexit, the UK will still be a member state of the EU. All the legislation which gives effect to EU law will still be in place. Nothing as a matter of law changes in any way just because of a vote to Leave. What will make all the legal difference is not a decision to leave by UK voters in a non-binding advisory vote, but the decision of the prime minister on making any Article 50 notification.', 'And what the prime minister will do politically after a referendum vote for Brexit is, at the moment, as unknown as the result of the referendum itself.']",1

"['The Michael Bay movie that explains Donald Trump better than ""Idiocracy"" does']","['Dwayne Johnson as Paul Doyle, Anthony Mackie as Adrian Doorbal and Mark Wahlberg as Daniel Lugo in ""Pain & Gain."" (Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount)', 'As people struggle to figure out what is happening in America that Donald Trump now seems likely to be the Republican nominee for president, one of the places they’ve turned is to popular culture, and not simply to Trump’s own long IMDb credits page. Mike Judge’s ""Idiocracy,"" about a man (Luke Wilson) who wakes up 500 years in the future to find that America has degenerated into a nation of fools, has become a kind of catechism for those who believe that Trump voters are TV-brainwashed morons. But I would argue that there’s a movie by another filmmaker that better captures Trump’s appeal.', 'The director is Michael Bay. The movie is ""Pain & Gain.""', 'Over the past couple of weeks, the strongest line of critique to emerge against Trump is that he’s a fraud, that his business success is a mirage and a front, that his claims to deal-making prowess would prove ephemeral and that he doesn’t believe anything that he says. But the backlash to those attacks has also been ferocious, as Trump voters fiercely reject the counsel of former party leaders such as Mitt Romney and John McCain.', 'If this is mystifying to some observers, the obvious answer is that his supporters don’t care if Trump is a fake; they find him appealing and inspiring anyway. ""Pain & Gain"" is a movie about that kind of thinking, about the disgust it inspires in response and about the unbridgeable gap between two very different visions of America.', '""Pain & Gain"" is set in Miami in 1994 and 1995, and as Ed Harris says in a voice-over toward the beginning of the film, ""Unfortunately, this is a true story."" It follows Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg), a personal trainer who wants to make more of his life, as he decides to extort one of his clients, Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), a plan that escalates into torture and murder. Eventually, a retired private investigator named Ed DuBois (Harris) gets curious enough to take Victor’s case. DuBois’s pursuit of Lugo makes for an entertaining detective story, but it’s also a contest between two radically different understandings of the American idea.', 'Lugo is driven by a kind of bewildered grievance, a confusion that all the work he’s put into bodybuilding hasn’t earned him the respect, the material goods and romantic success he believes should be his under the terms of the American social contract:', '""If you’re willing to do the work, you can have anything. That’s what makes the U.S. of A. great. When it started, America was just a handful of scrawny colonies. Now, it’s the most buffed, pumped-up country on the planet. That’s pretty rad,"" Lugo insists in the monologue that kicks off ""Pain & Gain."" ""Most people say they want to look better. Not everyone’s willing to do whatever it takes to achieve it. All of my heroes are self-made: Rocky, Scarface, all the guys from ‘The Godfather.’ They all started out with nothing and built their way to perfection. The way to prove yourself is to better yourself. That’s the American Dream. I have no sympathy for people who squander their gifts. It’s sickening. It’s worse than sickening. It’s unpatriotic.""', 'Throw in some references to ""losers"" and ""low-energy"" people and Trump could use this as a stump speech.', 'But Daniel isn’t coming to these ideas entirely on his own. If there’s a Trump-like figure in the movie, it’s Jonny Wu (Ken Jeong), a motivational speaker who tours under the slogan ""Get Off Your Lazy American [A–],"" brags about having dumped his wife for a roster of seven girlfriends and peddles an insipid plan for self-improvement:', 'Wu is obviously a manipulative hack — if a effective one — but ""Pain & Gain"" makes clear why he’s appealing to people like Lugo. Wu is excellent at furnishing his listeners with catchy mantras that seem to set a confusing world in order a la Trump’s ""Make America Great Again,"" and in his three-piece suits and parade of honeys, he embodies a very particular vision of high class. If he expressed his fondness for pink marble and wasn’t Asian, Wu might be close to an explicit riff on Trump himself, his seminars the fictional equivalent of the legally embattled Trump University.', 'And when Wu singles Lugo out for special attention at a seminar, he makes Lugo feel recognized and appreciated after years of believing that he’s been chronically overlooked and underrated. Never mind that Wu’s demand that Lugo declare himself ""a do-er or a don’t-er"" is standard audience participation schtick, or that when Wu gives Lugo a private training session it’s clear that he can’t wait to bail on the overeager man standing in front of him. Lugo intuits a personal connection, just as Trump voters feel exhilarated and validated by their candidate’s crass rejection of establishment politicians and establishment values.', 'And in what he believes to be in keeping with Wu’s teaching, Lugo pulls together his friends Adrian (Anthony Mackie) and Paul (a fantastic Dwayne Johnson) to kidnap Kershaw, and later to try to pull the same stunt on Frank Griga (Michael Rispoli), a wealthy operator of phone sex lines.', 'The bloody path Lugo, Adrian and Paul travel down brings them into conflict with two men who have a radically different sense of how to live out American values.', 'Lugo chooses Kershaw as a target because he despises the man as a braggart who doesn’t work hard in the gym and, frankly, because Lugo can’t understand why Kershaw is wealthy while he is not. But as Kershaw explains, he’s equally determined: He just invests his energy in other ways.', '""My grandfather fled Germany in 1943. I was born in Bogota, grew up in New York City. Put myself through college working six nights a week at Pizza Hut,"" Kershaw tells us in a voice-over during his captivity. ""Busted my [a–], but ended up comptroller of a billion-dollar pipeline in the rectum of the Third World. I put up with [s—] they don’t have names for in civilization.""', 'And just as Lugo hates Kershaw, Kershaw is disgusted by Lugo. After Lugo has locked up Kershaw in his own warehouse, Kershaw tells him bitterly that Lugo’s failures are his own fault, that he’s broke because he never went to college and because he’s focused on building his body rather than developing plans for a viable business.', 'Lugo goes ballistic, as he does again later in the movie when Griga says that he doesn’t think Lugo is ""a hard worker"" and he doesn’t trust Lugo to run a business. Both men hit on Lugo’s deepest fear, the one that makes him most vulnerable and volatile: the idea that his dissatisfaction might be his own fault, rather than someone else’s. In Griga’s case, exposing the delusion and denial that define Lugo’s life will prove fatal.', 'The presidential election has, thus far, been blessedly spared the sort of violence that shows up in ""Pain & Gain."" But the race is defined by an eerily similar dynamic. Calling Trump voters racist, or dumb, or crass, did not, unsurprisingly, persuade hordes of them to vote for John Kasich, or Jeb Bush, or even Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio instead. Instead, every attempt to delegitimize Trump has exposed and broadened the gaps between Americans with radically different, and perhaps irreconcilable, views of their country. And Trump’s rallies have often been punctuated by ugly incidents in which attendees get rough with protesters — sometimes at Trump’s behest — turning on anyone who interrupts Trump’s communion with his audiences.', 'That gap is evident at the end of ""Pain & Gain,"" too. The movie closes with Kershaw regaining at least some of his wealth, and DuBois sitting on the dock outside of his beautiful, modernist house, staring at the water with his wife and enjoying the good fortune he earned through honest work. Lugo, by contrast, is on death row.', 'But just because he’s locked up doesn’t mean he’s given up his dreams about what he deserves, or his idea of what it means to be American. And just as Trump is a unique figure, he’s exposed a deep vein of discontent that both Republicans and Democrats will have to reckon with in years to come.', '""All I ever wanted out of life was what everyone else had. Not more. Just not the less I was used to. Well, I took a real swing for it, you know?"" Lugo muses in the prison yard. ""And for a while, it was like I always thought it would be. I was one of you. And it felt good. People finally saw me like I saw myself and you can’t ask for more than that. Maybe I did, though. Maybe it got so I didn’t want to be ‘equal to’ anymore. I wanted to be ‘better than.’ And that’s a recipe for injury. That doesn’t mean you give up, though. You rest, you heal and you get back on that bench. Life is going to give me another set. And I am going to rock it.""']",1

It was hardly an arbitrary choice: Steve Jobs had been a big fan of shapes with subtle rounded corners for more than 20 years before the iPhone even launched.', 'If we go back to the early 80s when Apple was working on the Lisa, Steve Jobs became obsessed with rounded rectangles. In an anecdote originally relayed by Andy Hertzfeld on Folklore, Jobs hounded Apple engineer Bill Atkinson to develop software that could ably create such shapes. At the time, Atkinson had developed software capable of drawing ovals and circles.', 'But something was bothering Steve Jobs. ""Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners? Can we do that now, too?"" ""No, there’s no way to do that. In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don’t think we really need it"". I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn’t raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more. Steve suddenly got more intense. ""Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!"". And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. ""And look outside, there’s even more, practically everywhere you look!"". He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.', 'With Jobs pestering him at every turn, Atkinson got to work and eventually figured out a way to get his software to render rounded rectangles. As development of the Lisa (and later the Macintosh) continued, Hertzfeld relays that rounded rectangles ""worked their way into various parts of the user interface, and soon became indispensable.""', 'And so, when the iPhone was released more than 25 years later, it wasn’t at all surprising to see that the iOS icons all featured rounded edges. Furthermore, Apple’s penchant for rounded corners is also evident in various apps, such as the chat bubbles in iMessage.', 'In contrast, look at how much harsher a chat UI with more pointed corners looks.', 'Broadly speaking, design gurus and psychologists have both said that there’s something more soothing and welcoming about rounded corners relative to sharp corners.', 'DesignModo points out:', 'Sharp corners interrupt thought. To visualize a sharp-cornered shape, the brain processes point A to point B, pauses for a bit and then goes from point B to C, and so forth until it completes the circuit. In the case of a rectangle, it takes your brain 4 computations to recognize it. With rounded corners, the abrupt pause never happens, and your brain only does one single computation as your eyes smoothly scan its edges.', 'If the intersection of design and psychology is of interest to you, UXmovement has an interesting piece on rounded vs. sharp corners that’s worth taking a look at.']",1

Instead, Brady hit Amendola on an out route against Falcons cornerback Brian Poole to extend the Patriots' drive. Their win expectancy would come close to 0.3 percent later on, but never quite dip below what it was prior to that completion."", ""The Patriots' drive continued with Brady scrambling for 15 yards when the Falcons lost containment on a third-and-8, finishing with Brady finding James White out of the backfield on a snag concept for a 5-yard touchdown to make the score 28-9."", 'Two things then went against the Patriots in successive fashion. Stephen Gostkowski promptly booted the ensuing extra point attempt against the upright, leaving the score at 28-9. Given that the Patriots had incorrectly been called for an illegal formation penalty earlier in the game that gave the Falcons a second chance at an extra point, New England had lost two points on conversions. It seemed mostly irrelevant at the time, but it would loom as incredibly important later on.', 'Gostkowski followed that by taking an illegal touching penalty on an attempted onside kick, one which the Falcons recovered anyway.

We know that each attempt is independent, and given the 50 percent conversion rate, we would expect them to convert one out of two tries and produce a total of two points. The Patriots pulled it out here, but the 2015 Patriots and 2016 Chiefs can remind you of how leaving the game to a late two-point try is far from guaranteed."", ""An older version of the win expectancy model developed by ESPN's Brian Burke suggests the Patriots' chances of winning with a touchdown on fourth-and-15 would have leaped to 3.6 percent, producing that 9 percent break-even rate. It's not a perfect parallel, since teams would likely be willing to settle for field goals, but since 2006, teams have converted third-and-goal from the 15-yard line five times in 45 tries. That's a 10.6 percent rate, and it's reasonable to think the Patriots are better than your standard offense.

His throw wasn't perfect, giving Alford a chance to pick the ball off. Instead, Alford tipped the ball into the air and somehow gave Edelman a chance to bring it in on a double-clutch. I've watched the play 20 times and I'm still convinced Edelman's going to drop the ball each time I watch it."", ""I'm of two minds regarding Dan Quinn's challenge after the catch. Ideally, Quinn would have let the clock run to the two-minute warning and spent the break watching replays before deciding to use his final timeout on a challenge. The television feed of the game doesn't make it clear whether the Patriots would have been able to run a play before the two-minute warning, although it was very clear that the Patriots were sprinting to the line in the hopes of running a play before Quinn could get a good look. (The coaches tape of the game will not be available until midweek.)"", ""The play was obviously close, and it was literally Quinn's last chance to use a challenge. Twenty-three yards isn't an enormous swing of field position, but the Pats would have been in second-and-10. Quinn's challenge stopped the clock before the two-minute warning, and the Pats used the extra play to complete a deep crossing route to Amendola for 20 more yards versus Poole. That would push the Patriots up into double digits at 13.2 percent. Three plays later, on the Atlanta 1-yard line, the Pats punched the ball in."", ""Second-and-goal, Falcons' 1: White rushes for 1-yard touchdown; Amendola converts two-pointer. Win expectancy shift: 21.2 percent to 53.0 percent (+31.8 percent)"", ""There's the big leap. The Patriots, who were 55.7 percent favorites to win as of the opening kickoff, are favored again to prevail for the first time since LeGarrette Blount's fumble on the second play of the second quarter. If it felt like the Patriots were destined to win in overtime, I won't blame you, but I'll also remind you of last year's Packers-Cardinals playoff game, when Aaron Rodgers converted two Hail Mary passes to tie the game up just before overtime and never touched the ball again. You may also remember Super Bowl XXXVI, when the Rams tied the score with 1:13 left and the Patriots drove 53 yards with no timeouts (against the advice of John Madden) to set up Adam Vinatieri's game-winning field goal."", ""Atlanta still might have been able to muster a drive to at least attempt a game-winning field goal. The Patriots helped out by making a strategic mistake and snapping the ball with 21 seconds to go on the game clock during the White touchdown. It's not necessarily a good idea to run the play clock down to one second left before snapping the ball, but Brady should have shaved another 10-12 seconds off the clock before the snap. The argument that the Patriots needed to conserve time in case of a failed two-point conversion doesn't really hold water; if the Patriots failed, they were going to be stuck attempting an expected onside kick to try to get one final possession. The chances of recovering that onside kick are likely lower than the chances of giving up a meaningful drive to the Falcons with a minute left on the clock."", ""Instead, fortunately for the Patriots, Atlanta's drive started on the 11-yard line and sputtered out after 16 yards. New England then hoped to set up for a game-winning fair catch free kick, but Matt Bosher's punt was too far to feasibly attempt one. The Pats then sent Lewis out to run a meaningless draw with three seconds left, with Lewis suffering a game-ending hamstring injury on the play."", ""Second-and-13, Falcons' 40: Brady hits Edelman for 15 yards. Win expectancy shift: 58.5 percent to 75.5 percent (+17.0 percent)"", ""The biggest play of New England's lone drive in overtime turned a difficult second-and-13 into a first down, putting the Patriots in field goal range and on the edge of the red zone. The Patriots went five-wide, and the Falcons responded by showing pre-snap pressure before dropping into a Cover 1 Robber look, with one deep safety and the impressive Deion Jones lurking in the middle of the field to take away drag routes. The Patriots went back to an impeccably timed combination of crossing routes, which the Falcons had been able to knock away during the fourth quarter. This time, though, the timing was excellent to create a subtle rub downfield, and Brady's throw was right on the money. Four plays later, the Patriots were champions."", ""Those are the plays that led the Patriots to their stunning Super Bowl victory, but what was changing in the broader matchup of the game that allowed the Patriots to come back? How could the Falcons allow Brady & Co. to score the final 31 points of the game after going up 28-3 halfway through the third quarter? Let's run through the ways the Patriots improved and the Falcons declined as the game went along, starting with one critical component ..."", ""The Atlanta pass rush disappeared. I wrote in my Super Bowl preview that the game would turn on whether the Falcons would be able to get pass pressure on Brady. I was right about that, but I was wrong about whether the Falcons would be able to pester the future Hall of Famer. Quinn's defense spent most of the day in Brady's face, and it did so without blitzing. Atlanta sent an extra man on just 7.4 percent of Brady's dropbacks but was able to get plenty of pressure with its front four. Through the first three quarters, Atlanta pressured Brady on 44.7 percent of his dropbacks."", ""As was the case in both of New England's Super Bowl losses to the Giants, much of that pressure came up the middle. Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who had all of three sacks during the regular season, came up with three sacks of Brady in the Super Bowl alone, tying the championship game record. Jarrett and his teammates abused Patriots right guard Shaq Mason, who had a dismal night in pass protection. NFL sack leader Vic Beasley had a mostly quiet night, finishing with a lone knockdown of Brady and a pass breakup on a fade to Martellus Bennett on the penultimate play of the game, which was apparently Josh McDaniels' ode to Darrell Bevell."", ""As the game went along, though, the plays simply began to add up. Atlanta's defense faced nearly twice as many snaps as New England's; the 93-47 disparity between the two was the largest gap in NFL playoff history, per the Elias Sports Bureau. Those 93 offensive plays represent the second most a team has faced in playoff history (behind only the Jets, who faced 96 against the Browns in a game that went into double-overtime in January 1987)."", ""By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, Atlanta's pass rush was gassed. During the fourth quarter and overtime, its pressure rate on Brady fell from 44.7 percent down to 20.0 percent, including an O-fer on Brady's six pass attempts during the extra period. Unsurprisingly, once the pass pressure went away, Brady picked the Falcons apart. He finished the day with a 64.1 passer rating under duress and a 107.0 mark when avoiding pressure."", ""The Patriots successfully attacked the weaker links in the Atlanta secondary. Again, this shouldn't have been news given the expectations coming into the game, but the Falcons were able to hold up with relatively anonymous defensive backs making plays during the first half. Deji Olatoye and C.J. Goodwin played a combined 18 defensive snaps during the first two rounds of the playoffs, but with the Falcons playing more two-deep coverage at first glance and the Patriots using more three- and four-wideout sets, the Falcons rotated their backup defensive backs into the game for a combined 47 snaps. Goodwin, in particular, made his mark in the first half by knocking away a fade route to Mitchell out of the slot and tackling White in the open field on third down to end a drive."", ""As the game wore on, though, the Patriots began to take advantage of mismatches in the secondary. They matched up Mitchell against Goodwin for critical conversions during the comeback, including a third-and-11 pickup in the fourth quarter to extend the drive. Combinations of curl routes are a great way to beat Cover 3, and Mitchell went after both Goodwin and the larger Collins, who had trouble in space against New England's speedier wideouts. Poole also had trouble with Amendola, who had eight catches for 78 yards and a touchdown in what might have been his final game as a member of the organization."", ""They also found mismatches for White, who caught a Super Bowl-record 14 passes in much the same way that Shane Vereen took over at times against Quinn's Seattle defense during Super Bowl XLIX. White became a coverage problem for Deion Jones and De'Vondre Campbell, much as he was frustrating against Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright versus the Seahawks."", ""They took Blount out of the game for White. Blount seemed like a logical fit to play a big role in this contest, given how the Falcons had the league's fourth-worst run defense during the regular season and are built around speed as opposed to strength, but it didn't work out. Blount dragged down the Patriots' offense in the first half, carrying the ball eight times for just 16 yards, including a third-and-1 stuff and a lost fumble."", ""The Pats trotted him out for three consecutive runs late in the third quarter, but otherwise, he was basically left on the bench as New England launched its comeback. He finished the game taking just 17 offensive snaps, while White finished with 71 snaps. To put that in context, no Patriots running back had suited up for more than 48 offensive plays in a game this year. ESPN has player participation data going back through 2007, and the only Belichick running back to top White's 71 snaps over that time frame was Danny Woodhead, who took 73 snaps during a 41-35 thriller against the 49ers in 2012."", ""Brady's receivers stopped dropping passes. I don't think Brady would characterize this as his sharpest game, as he missed a number of receivers downfield, notably a streaking Edelman on a wheel route. He also didn't get a ton of help early on. Brady's receivers dropped three of his 35 passes through the first three quarters (an 8.6 percent clip), and there were a number of 50-50 passes his wideouts failed to bring in. (Ryan's receivers, in comparison, didn't drop any of his 23 pass attempts.) The Patriots' wideouts repeatedly struggled on a route they clearly wanted to target in man coverage, the wheel/fade out of the slot."", ""Bennett caught a 25-yard pass over Neal on that very route in the fourth quarter, though, and the Pats went back to it with Bennett in overtime for the pass interference penalty that set up the game-winning score. Brady's receivers stepped up their concentration and made every catch count; they didn't drop a single one of Brady's 27 pass attempts during the fourth quarter and overtime."", 'The Patriots sent extra men at Ryan. The 2016 MVP dropped back 10 times during the first half, and while he was sacked twice, the other eight plays produced seven receptions for 115 yards, a touchdown and a perfect passer rating of 158.3. The Patriots blitzed just once on those 10 dropbacks for a 10 percent blitz rate. During the second half, the Pats brought in Elandon Roberts for Shea McClellin in their nickel package and blitzed far more frequently. This was also just a 17-dropback sample, but the Patriots blitzed Ryan 41.2 percent of the time and sacked him on three of those opportunities. Ryan still posted a 126.8 passer rating, but because QBR accounts for sacks, his QBR fell from 91.5 in the first half to 62.0 afterward.', ""Ryan's tackles were not a source of strength, particularly Matthews, who was a liability in pass protection far too frequently Sunday and committed those two critical holding penalties. Right tackle Ryan Schraeder was fine before leaving with an injury, but then the Falcons bought in Tom Compton, whom the Patriots immediately targeted with a defensive line game on that ridiculous 27-yard catch by Julio Jones. Behind the league's healthiest offensive line, Compton had been needed for only 69 offensive snaps during the regular season. The pressure prevented the Falcons from throwing more passes to Jones, who finished with four catches on a mere four targets for 87 yards."", ""The Atlanta running game sputtered. The biggest surprise of the game for me early on was that the Falcons had tons of success moving the ball on the ground against the league's fourth-ranked rushing defense per DVOA. Shanahan dialed up the crack toss play against New England in man coverage early on in the contest and had plenty of success, including a 37-yard run by Freeman. He and Coleman combined for 86 yards on nine carries during the first 30 minutes."", 'Afterward, though, the Patriots adjusted. They again faced nine rushing attempts during the second half, but this time, those runs generated a total of only 18 yards. Five of them went for no gain or a loss.', ""The Falcons didn't manage the clock well. While the Falcons couldn't have known that New England would make its miraculous comeback, they helped the Patriots by leaving time on the clock in the fourth quarter and snapping early in the play clock. After the 39-yard checkdown to a wide-open Freeman gave Atlanta first-and-10 at their own 49-yard line with 5:39 to go, Ryan snapped the ball with 20 seconds left on the play clock and handed the ball off for a loss of 1. The next play, the 27-yard deep out to Jones, was snapped with 13 seconds left on the clock. The Falcons did wind the play clock down inside five seconds on their next opportunity after a Freeman stuff, but that was their last chance to run clock on offense all game."", ""Quinn also didn't get much value for his timeouts. Atlanta had to use one timeout early in the third quarter when they were struggling to line up on defense before a third-and-long. A second timeout came after the first Matthews holding penalty toward the end of the third quarter on second-and-11, while the final timeout flew off the shelves when Quinn challenged the ridiculous Edelman catch. If Ryan hits that final drive with a minute and two timeouts, the playcalling would have been fundamentally different."", ""Gostkowski was a monster on kickoffs. While Gostkowski missed yet another extra point in what has been an uneven season for New England's star kicker on scoring plays, he has retained much of his effectiveness on kickoffs and created valuable field position for the Patriots' defense in Sunday's second half. Gostkowski didn't kick off until the final play of the first half, and that was a squib kick. He subsequently attempted both an onside kick and a deliberately short pop-up kick on two of his five kickoff attempts during the second half."", ""His other three kickoffs, though, each pinned the Falcons inside of their own 20-yard line. One was returned to the Falcons' 19-yard line, but the two truly great kicks came on Gostkowski's final two kickoffs of the game. The first, with the Patriots down 28-20, was booted to the 3-yard line with enough hang time for the coverage units to pin down Justin Hardy and limit him to a 7-yard return, starting Atlanta on the 10-yard line. Given that the Falcons finished the drive a few desperate yards away from what would have been game-sealing field goal range, Gostkowski's kickoff might have helped save the season. After the Patriots tied the score, Gostkowski delivered a similarly effective kickoff to the goal line, which Eric Weems returned to his own 11-yard line to start a disappointingly short possession."", ""The Atlanta offense couldn't stay on the field. More than anything, though, the Falcons blew their lead because they couldn't come through with conversions on third down. They had picked up 64.0 percent of their third downs in the playoffs heading into the Super Bowl, but went just 1-for-8 on Sunday, with a second conversion coming on a ninth third down via penalty."", ""Every third-down failure is bad for an offense, but these breakdowns were both wildly frustrating and eventually very meaningful. Ryan was sacked four times on third down, including on third-and-3 and third-and-5 to end Atlanta's first two possessions. The Hightower strip-sack came on a third-and-1. He also took a sack on third-and-11 from the Patriots' 42-yard line on a play where a completion, even if it were short of the sticks, might have created an opportunity for a long field goal. Nobody expected Ryan to convert third-and-33 from the Patriots' 45-yard line in the fourth quarter, but he failed to complete a pass that might have set up Bryant for a field goal or even forced the Patriots into using one of their two remaining timeouts."", ""Atlanta's two third-down conversions resulted in touchdowns. One was a touchdown itself, when the Falcons isolated tight end Austin Hooper against Patrick Chung on consecutive plays. The other was a pass interference call in the red zone on Malcolm Butler that set up a touchdown for Coleman on a pick play the following snap."", 'It\'s still hard to believe the Falcons actually lost this game. They\'re the first team in Super Bowl history to lose with a pick-six in its pocket, one that felt like an unlikely gift given that it came from Brady. Some will throw around the ""choker"" label, which is inelegant at best and condescendingly incurious at worst. If choking means running after a quarterback on 68 dropbacks until there\'s hardly any air left in your lungs, the Falcons choked.', ""Instead, it's fairer to say the Falcons never shut the door. They had several chances to finish this game off and never really took advantage of any of them, leaving a tiny opening that most teams wouldn't have been able to exploit. Even the Patriots, as good as they are, needed fortuitous timing with penalties and turnovers plus one of the all-time legendary catches in football history from Edelman to stay within range."", ""Atlanta should be proud of what it has accomplished this season and what it did in the Super Bowl. It's what the Falcons didn't do that will be keeping everyone in the organization up late at night for weeks to come. They gave Tom Brady and Bill Belichick a chance to kick their door down, and yet again, the two future Hall of Famers produced a late drive to come away with a Super Bowl victory.""]",1

That’s been the prevailing logic when it comes to minimizing your odds of divorce for some time now. But in a study released last month, University of Utah researcher Nicholas Wolfinger, PhD, asserts there is actually an optimal age range for lasting marriage — and you shouldn’t waitlong. He found that likelihood of divorce is lowest when you get hitched between the ages of 28 and 32.', 'Wolfinger, an adjunct professor of sociology at the university, had previously found a U-shaped relationship between age at marriage and likelihood of divorce by looking at data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) back in 2006 to 2010. The NSFG polled more 22,000 men and women aged 15 to 44 on topics ranging from factors determining marriage and divorce, to attitudes about sex and pregnancy.', 'Ever the good researcher, Wolfinger wanted to see if he could replicate those initial findings by pulling additional NSFG stats from 2011 to 2013.

"[""How Elizabeth Warren's own book makes the case she should run for president""]","['WASHINGTON -- Sen. Elizabeth Warren is adamant that she is not seeking to move up to the White House.', '""I am not running for president,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told The Huffington Post, as she has told many others. ""You can ask that question any way you want, but you\'re going to get the same answer.""', ""That's not exactly the question HuffPost was asking, though. The question was why readers of her new memoir and political treatise, A Fighting Chance, shouldn't take from it a very powerful argument for why Warren should run."", 'All through the book, despite her Shermanesque declarations of non-intent, can be found passages that suggest the logical next step for the middle-class girl from Oklahoma who grew into a champion for social justice is to seek the office where she could have the greatest impact.', 'Indeed, the argument for why she should attempt to go beyond even her unlikely ascension to the U.S. Senate two years ago begins on Page 2 of her book.', '""I am determined -- fiercely determined -- to do everything I can to help us once again be the America that creates opportunities for anyone who works hard and plays by the rules. An America of accountability and fair play. An America that builds a future for not just some of our children but for all of our children. An America where everyone gets what I got: a fighting chance,"" Warren writes.', 'Perhaps Warren does not think that climbing onto the high-profile platform of a presidential bid lands in the category of doing ""everything I can."" But her book also shows how often in her public career she looked at the lay of the land and said no, or at least hesitated. She often had to be convinced.', 'When former Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) asked Warren to join the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in 1995, she balked at first, but was then convinced by the opportunity to improve the laws in concrete ways. Not long after, Synar died, and the goal all but died with him.', 'President Bill Clinton appointed a lawyer named Brady Williamson to continue the work.', '""When Brady called, I was blunt: Mike and I had a deal, but that was then. Mike is gone, and I\'m out of here,"" Warren recounts in her book.', ""Williamson responded that ordinary bankrupt Americans had no political clout, that banks would make a bad situation worse if they dictated the commission's work, and that even though Warren couldn't make the reforms she had initially hoped, every day that they at least preserved the best aspects of the old laws was a day that some 5,000 people could use them to get a fresh start."", '""Lord this was discouraging,"" Warren writes of their conversation. ""But I signed on, and we started stacking sandbags as quick as we could. Maybe we\'d lose in the end, but every day we held on was a better day for struggling families.""', 'Helping people trumped her distaste for the project. It was a similar situation when President Barack Obama asked her to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He wanted her to set it up, but -- for political reasons -- not to lead it.', ""She told him no at first, fearing she wouldn't have the authority to build the agency that she thought was needed. Obama pleaded for her to trust him before she finally decided she would do it."", 'And when Democrats wanted her to run for the Senate seat in Massachusetts, she writes, ""I really didn\'t want to run. I\'d had enough of Washington."" Her family was telling her, ""We love you and we don\'t want to see you hurt. Please stay out.""', 'But she thought about what a senator could accomplish:', ""[T]here was so much at stake in this election. I'd spent nearly twenty years fighting to level the playing field for the middle class, and I'd seen millions of working families go over the economic cliff -- and it was getting worse. What kind of country would my grandchildren grow up in? What if the conservatives and the big banks and the big-time CEOs got their way, and Washington kept helping the rich and powerful to get richer and more powerful? Could I really stand on the sidelines and stay out of this fight?"", 'So she dipped her toe in the water, visiting small gatherings around the Bay State, until she met a woman who had walked miles to meet her. Warren writes that she decided to run after she was moved by this woman\'s tale. The woman declared, ""I don\'t care how hard it gets, I want to know that you are going to fight.""', ""In her book, Warren, who used to teach Sunday school, suggests that she has an almost religious calling to fight the good fight. She explains how she's inspired by the words of the King James Bible and how she offered their wisdom in a visit to a church."", '""I stood up, and I talked about my favorite Bible verse, Matthew 25:40,"" she writes. ""I told people what it meant to me. It\'s message was very simple: The Lord calls us to action. It\'s what we do that matters most.""', 'Her takeaway from defeating Republican Sen. Scott Brown in 2012 has a similar tone.', '""What is the lesson of that day? When we fight, we can win. And when we get really fired up and fight shoulder to shoulder, we can do some pretty amazing things,"" she writes. ""Some say the rich and powerful now control Washington and always will. I say this battle isn\'t over yet. True, the playing field isn\'t level and the system is rigged. But we\'re putting up a heck of a fight, and we intend to keep on fighting.""', ""If such comments -- found throughout the book -- don't make an argument for Warren to try for the White House, here are the final two paragraphs:"", 'No one is asking for a handout. All we want is a country where everyone pays a fair share, a country where we build opportunities for all of us, a country where everyone plays by the same rules and everyone is held accountable. And we have begun to fight for it. I believe in us. I believe in what we can do together, in what we will do together. All we need is a fighting chance.', 'Warren can probably count on hearing those words come back to her many times over the coming months.', 'Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.

The report lays out in horrifying detail the mass surveillance, torture, enslavement and disappearances under Eritrea’s totalitarian regime since that country gained independence from Ethiopia in the early 1990s. The U.N. investigators said systemic human rights abuses in Eritrea are on a scale rarely seen anywhere else in the world and may constitute crimes against humanity.', 'The U.N. panel, which was established in June 2014, was not able to enter Eritrea, so investigators based their 484-page report on 550 interviews and 160 written statements from people who had fled the country. Many witnesses were still terrified to provide information to the commission, fearing the reach of Eritrean surveillance and consequences for their families back home, the report said.', 'Among those willing to tell their stories was an Eritrean who sketched out some of the gruesome torture methods being used and provided the drawings to the commission. A human rights investigator for the commission who helped draft the report said the artist’s identity was being kept strictly confidential for his or her protection.', '""The drawings were very useful to help us portray more vividly the suffering and humiliation described to us by many witnesses,"" she told The WorldPost.

They can beat you five minutes or an hour, as they wish,"" he said.', ""Otto: The victims' arms are tied behind their backs and they're often made to lie facedown on the ground. © 2015 Eritrean torture survivor"", 'It is hardly surprising, the commission said, that many Eritreans are trying to flee their country. Leaving itself is dangerous, as the government keeps the border sealed with lethal force and locks up those suspected of planning to escape. If they manage to get out, more peril awaits.

['65-year-old model explains secret to aging naturally'],"['One look at Linda Rodin, and it\'s easy to see why Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen cast her as a model in their recent ad campaign for The Row. The 65-year-old skincare guru is wearing her signature bright pink lipstick and oversized eyeglasses. Her white hair is tied into a simple low ponytail. She radiates ""chic"" in an all-black ensemble, but nothing about her reads overly classic or stuffy -- she\'s undeniably contemporary.', 'As she should be. Rodin started her eponymous skincare line in 2008 after a long career in the fashion industry, enjoying a brief stint as a model in the \'60s and a successful tenure as a stylist for the likes of Harper\'s Bazaar, Gisele Bundchen and Madonna. ""It\'s funny to think that people want to take my photograph -- why didn\'t they want to take it when I had no wrinkles?"" she joked when we met in New York recently.', 'But Rodin\'s certainly grateful for the opportunity to model, especially when it involves working with the Olsens. ""I knew they respected me and they knew I wasn\'t going to show up... young,"" she said. Response to the campaign has been overwhelmingly positive, indicating that perhaps the industry is ready to accept images of models above the age of 20... at least if the Olsens say so. Rodin explained: ""I think that was what was so interesting: If those two girls find this amazing, when they\'re on the cutting edge of everything, there must be something to it.""', 'It would appear there is. More and more magazines and brands, like Marks & Spencer and TK Maxx in the UK, are enlisting mature women to star in photoshoots. Some models, like Sarah Wiley, are even scouted after they turn 50. There is a ""whole gang of us roaming around,"" Wiley, 66, told Stella Magazine last month. That ""gang"" includes 85-year-old Daphne Selfe, 81-year-old Jenni Rhodes and 82-year-old Carmen Dell\'Orefice, who\'s been working steadily as a model since the age of 15.', 'As for Rodin, she had a full-page feature in American Vogue in August 2011, and she also posed for upcoming issues of Dutch magazine Rikka and Canadian magazine Fashion. But the last time she had seriously modeled was in the late \'60s while living in Italy to study Italian. It was only in 2012, when J.Crew asked Rodin to model in its fall catalogue, that she came back in front of the camera. ""I always feel like they\'re using me as not just a model, but someone with something going on,"" she said. ""I\'m not just an old lady who they think looks cute in clothes.""', 'It\'s easy to make the argument that a brand\'s choice to cast an older model is shtick, especially when many models are actually under the legal drinking age (and those who aren\'t are altered to look that way via Photoshop). ""I think the whole culture\'s screwed up,"" Rodin said, noting the irony. ""They retouch 20-year-olds. I work with them, and I see the pictures, and I know that they\'ve retouched this and that and that and this. I just go, \'She doesn\'t even have any wrinkles!\'""', 'Fortunately, Rodin hasn\'t succumbed to the pressure to look younger unnaturally (though she experimented with fillers and Botox briefly). She\'s never dyed her hair, which went gray in her mid-30s, and she has never even considered getting a facelift. (""Aren\'t we curious to see how we\'d grow up?"") Instead, she\'s established a simple beauty regimen using only her own products (""I\'ve got my own little universe""), and she claims she owes her glowing complexion to her namesake brand\'s enormously popular face oil, Olio Lusso.', '""I first made it in my bathroom,"" she says, by simply mixing essential oils purchased at a health food store together in a teacup until she created the perfect concoction for her skin. Rodin began handing out small vials of the oil to models, photographers and celebrities on the photo shoots she styled. Before she knew it, Gwyneth Paltrow and Liv Tyler were vocal fans, and a cult following ensued.', '""It makes your skin radiate naturally,"" she said. ""It\'s not going to take away wrinkles. There\'s no miracle cream -- if there was, we\'d all have it.""', 'So rather than harp on the fine lines and freckles that come with aging naturally, Rodin\'s chosen to focus on looking the best she can while being healthy. ""I\'m never going to look younger; it\'s a folly,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, I\'m not going to fix anything, so I might as well embrace it.""', ""Considering all of the top-tier modeling gigs she's booking, that strategy seems to be working well for Rodin. As of now, she's having fun modeling and focusing on the product launches set for her brand this year, which include a powder face wash and a fragrance inspired by her mother. With this level of energy, it's no wonder the woman is helping to set the bar for longevity in the fashion, beauty and modeling worlds. But the wisdom and perspective she's gained have only come with age."", '""I remember when I was 24 saying to somebody, \'You know, I\'m really getting up there -- I\'m 24!\' I was embarrassed by how old I was. Can you believe that? 24 and you\'re making excuses? What was I thinking?"" she said. "" And now, I want to be 90. I want to be old and healthy.""']",1

These boxes are great for many reasons ― they’re inexpensive and easily recyclable ― but the thin cardboard lid does tend to sag. And if the center of the lid is depressed enough to make contact with the pizza within, all hell breaks loose. The cheese is ripped off the pizza and sticks to the top of the box.', 'According to Gizmodo, a Long Island woman named Carmela Vitale recognized this problem back in the 1980s, and set about inventing a fix. Vitale came up with designs for the pizza saver, or as she called it, a ""package saver,"" in 1983. Vitale submitted a patent request for the design that year, and her patent was approved in 1985.', 'While not every pizza delivery company uses them and they currently sell for less than one cent apiece, Eater estimates that a single manufacturer of pizza savers could be raking in as much as $8 million per year because of the high volume of pizza sales. Unfortunately, it appears that Vitale never manufactured pizza savers herself, Eater reports: She let her patent lapse in 1993, and she passed away in 2005.', 'The next time you crack open your pizza box, thank Vitale and her pizza saver for keeping your cheesy slice of heaven intact.']",1
"[""In 15 Years, The 9-5 Workday Will Be A Thing Of The Past. Here's Why.""]","['As millennials begin to join the work force in larger and larger numbers, the values that they hold will cease to be novel requests and will quite simply become the way of doing things. And one of the things to go will be the ubiquity of the 9-5 workday. Long a tenet of most any professional job, advancements in technology, and a cultural breach from traditional work values have made for a generation of workers that hold flexible work schedules near and dear to their hearts.', 'According to this study by Bentley University, 77% of millennials believe that a flexible work schedule will make their workday more productive, and that says nothing about the personal values that a flexible workday serves better than the static 9-5 schedule.', 'To that end, a flexible schedule better accommodates work-family balance that millennials have shown to value more than previous generations. Getting kids to school and even picking them up means that hours would need to be made up either earlier in the morning or later at night, which means not only will work hours change, but telecommuting will become a standard practice in even the most traditional industries.', 'Millennials have also proven to value continuing education and new career experiences more than those before them. Two years ago, corporate training grew by 15%, and that number is likely to continue to rise as workers seek a more diverse array of responsibilities and opportunities. More of the 9-5 workday could be consumed with programs like these, leaving many work tasks to be done outside of those hours.', 'Offices are expensive. And increasingly less essential. Rented spaces housing data analysts or sales people with low degrees of interaction with other internal groups is a luxury that many companies are dispensing with. By 2030, it’s imagined that most (yes, MOST) employees will work at home with superfast data connections, allowing for video conferencing, desktop sharing, and collaboration the likes of which we’re just beginning to see. The notion of ""office hours"" becomes quaint when there’s no office to speak of.', 'If those three reasons don’t serve as a tipping point, then it’s extremely likely that the fourth will. Those 77% of millennials were right. Flexible work hours DO make employees more productive. Removing the time spent traveling to the office and the distractions that the group dynamic provides made tele-commuting workers 13% more productive in one study of a Chinese firm.', 'Of course, all the data and studies in the world won’t convince managers the same way observed results do, but as these practices get rolled out incrementally, there will be plenty of practical data points for companies to draw from, which in turn will create a level of trust that sees the traditional 9-5 workday become the exception, not the rule.']",1

But it suggests that Stewart, like many people in the media industry, confuses what we do with true clickbait. We have admittedly (and at times deliberately) not done a great job of explaining why we have always avoided clickbait at BuzzFeed.', 'In fact — and here is a trade secret I’d decided a few years ago we’d be better off not revealing — clickbait stopped working around 2009.', 'I avoided talking about it because, well, a lot of our rivals hadn’t yet figured it out and were becoming addicted to and deeply reliant on misleading headlines; since we weren’t, there seemed to be no harm (to us) in letting others focus on the short-term.

Meanwhile, the many publisher Twitter accounts that auto-tweeted dozens of misleading, over-torqued headlines became Twitter’s favorite joke — and spawned a set of fairly useful ""spoiler"" accounts.', 'Now it’s no longer much of a secret that clickbait doesn’t work. BuzzFeed News’ Charlie Warzel wrote a nuanced history of the topic not long ago. The Verge’s Nilay Patel probably described our position better than we ever have in an interview with Poynter:', '""Most clickbait is disappointing because it’s a promise of value that isn’t met — the payoff isn’t nearly as good as what the reader imagines,"" Patel said.

Because you won’t believe what happens next...after the break. It’s a pretty rough consumer experience to demand your audience sit through an ad, online or off. The banner ad, whose decline Farhad Manjoo recently celebrated, was also born during this era and created a business model in which clicks are tied directly to dollars — something many people assume is still how all online publishers make their money. But BuzzFeed has never sold a banner, and I couldn’t even tell you how many monthly page views we get. And so our business model at least moderates that incentive to drag every last click out of our audience.', 'The worst form of this online is on a pennies-per-click business model in the transactional netherworld of outsourced sponsored content sitting at the bottom of articles around the web. All that matters in that space is the snappy headline.

This is a very high bar. It’s one thing to enjoy reading something, and quite another to make the active choice to share it with your friends. This is a core fact of sharing and the social web of Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and other platforms.', 'The best way to ensure your readers won’t choose to share a story or a post is to trick them. Anyone who has spent the last 20 years online knows the specific disgust that comes with a headline that doesn’t deliver on its promise. It’s the kind of taste you get in your mouth from a glistening but spoiled peach. The publisher got the page view, and ComScore doesn’t record your flash of anger. But you’re hardly going to subject your friends to this experience. (Maybe your enemies.)', 'What makes a great headline', 'In fact, the only real trick is that the work has to be good. And the only thing, other than mediocrity, that can really sabotage this strategy is writing a headline that overpromises and a story that underdelivers.', 'Great headlines, meanwhile, tell you a lot about what you’re going to read, and persuade you to click because you know you’ll find a story that will satisfy your interest. The lists that BuzzFeed has long been known for are, as list titles tend to be, extremely direct; ""31 Genius Hacks For Your Elementary School Art Class"" is just that. As my colleague Ryan Broderick puts it, the goal is often, in fact, to ""blow away the curiosity gap.""

Most people don’t click on most headlines, but a good front page will inform you without forcing you to click. Vice’s incredible 2014 series ""The Islamic State"" was, if anything, underhyped. And you may not be among the many people who read Jina Moore’s recent dispatch headline, ""In Liberia, Everyone Says Ebola Cases Are Dropping"" — but if you saw the headline, you still learned something. A headline like ""You won’t believe what happened to this Ebola hospital"" might (maybe) get more clicks — but the reader who scans it gets nothing at all. It’s a form of pollution wherever it lives, whether on your homepage or your Twitter or Facebook feed.', 'Different people use the term ""clickbait"" differently, and it’s sometimes thrown our direction to characterize entertaining web culture content that the author doesn’t like.

"[""'Biggest Loser' Host Thinks Contestants Should Try This Trend Diet""]","['A recent study on past contestants on the weight loss reality show ""The Biggest Loser"" revealed that due to metabolic and hormonal changes that persist after massive weight loss, participants were burning hundreds of calories less than would be expected for someone their age and body composition -- making weight re-gain almost inevitable.', 'Of the 14 former participants who were profiled in the study, all but one had re-gained at least some weight, and five of them were back within one percent of their starting weight from before the televised competition.', 'Bob Harper, a personal trainer who hosts ""The Biggest Loser,"" addressed the study\'s disturbing findings during a segment on the ""Today"" show last Friday (both shows air on NBC). He proposed there might be one effective way to address the slowed metabolism that can result from dramatic weight loss: intermittent fasting.', 'For people who have lost weight in general, Harper advised them to continue on the diet that helped them lose weight in the first place. For example, if a person cut added sugars or highly-processed carbs, they should continue to do so in order to maintain the new weight.', 'But for the severely obese people described in the ""Biggest Loser"" study, or anyone whose metabolism has slowed dramatically, Harper also suggests intermittent fasting, which he actually follows himself. He suggested that skipping breakfast, or about 400 calories, could help them make up for the fact that their bodies are now burning hundreds of calories less than would be expected.', 'The increasingly popular diet could be one way to help maintain massive weight loss, he said.', 'What is intermittent fasting?', 'There are many different versions of intermittent fasting, but the basic principle behind this eating pattern is that alternating days of ""feast"" and ""famine"" can help your body shed fat, restore healthy insulin levels and perhaps even extend your life.', 'One popular intermittent fasting strategy is called the 5:2 fast diet. Followers eat however they like for five days, with little regard to calories or macronutrients, and then eat only 500 to 600 calories per day for two days, depending on whether they are a woman or a man. Any day can be a fast day, though the two fast days should not be successive.', 'Harper’s personal plan restricts all consumption to a 10-hour window. First, he fasts for 14 hours (yes, sleeping counts as fasting), and then he eats two substantial meals within the next ten hours. For those two meals of the day, Harper focuses on vegetables, healthy fats, and protein. It essentially boils down to him just skipping breakfast, he told ""Today"" host Savannah Guthrie.', '""Our bodies want to be the weight we have been for such a long time,"" said Harper. ""That’s why it’s such a battle; if you’ve been overweight for a long period of time, your body is going to fight you tooth and nail to get back.""', '""That’s why you have to be so diligent,"" he continued. ""You have to watch every single thing that you are doing, no matter if you’ve lost weight on \'The Biggest Loser,\' Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig -- however you’ve lost the weight.""', 'Does IF work?', 'If book sales and celebrity endorsements are any indication, intermittent fasting is experiencing a surge in popularity -- especially in the U.K., where the 5:2 fast was invented. And emerging research on intermittent fasting is encouraging. A 2015 meta-analysis of six studies that took place from 1975 to 2014 found that participants were able to lose an average of 8.9 percent of their weight after six months of intermittent fasting (this is across all types of intermittent fasting regimens). Three studies that also focused on keeping weight off found that participants were able to sustain a weight loss of 8.2 percent after one month of maintenance. Perhaps most importantly, the 20 percent participant dropout rate for those six studies was much lower than the attrition rates that usually plague weight loss studies, which can range from 10 to 80 percent.', 'Harper’s suggestion that people maintain weight loss with intermittent fasting is intriguing, but there is currently no scientific evidence to suggest that it would be effective in the long term, says Stephen Anton, chief of the clinical research division at the Department of Aging and Geriatric Research at the University of Florida. Anton, an expert on intermittent fasting, is not involved in ""The Biggest Loser,"" but he did review the ""Today"" show\'s report.', '""[Intermittent fasting] seems to be effective in producing some weight loss, because people do not compensate on their feasting days for the amount of calories that they did not eat on their fasting days,"" Anton told HuffPost. ""But those studies have been relatively short term, and it’s unknown what happens after the intervention is over.""', 'Not everyone should try intermittent fasting. Those who are hypoglycemic, diabetic or on certain medications should not fast, as prolonged periods of starvation can be uniquely damaging to them.', 'And like all diets, this eating pattern only works if a person can commit to following it for the rest of their life. Going off any diet can result in regained weight -- and most of it in the form of body fat -- so people should be cautious about embarking on diets that may be unsustainable in the long term, as Dr. Scott Isaacs of the Emory School of Medicine previously pointed out.']",1
"[""Don't eat these 16 cancer causing foods""]","['It’s probably not something you think about every day, whether or not the foods you are eating could contain carcinogens, but with almost 1.5 million people diagnosed with some type of cancer just last year, perhaps it’s time to look at what is in our foods that could be causing such a huge number of new cancer patients. Here is a list of the top 16 foods that you most likely consume every day that may contain carcinogens or be suspected of causing cancer.', '1. Canned Tomatoes', 'While fresh tomatoes are actually considered to be the cancer fighting foods, those canned ones are nothing like that. Actually, most canned foods are a concern because of what the can is lined with. The lining of almost all canned foods are made with a chemical called bisphenol-A, or BPA.', 'A study published in May of 2013 by the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences showed that BPA actually affects the way genes work inside the brain of rats. Even the FDA agrees that there is a problem with BPA as it is supporting efforts to either replace or at the very least, to minimize the amounts found in canned foods. You know it must be bad when even the very lax FDA is concerned!', 'Tomatoes are believed to be exceptionally dangerous due to their high acidity, which seems to cause BPA to leech from the lining of the can into the tomatoes themselves. The level of BPA can be so high in fact', 'you should seriously consider not feeding them to children. Due to FDA laws, there are no standards for labeling BPA so simply because a can does not say it has it does not mean that it does not contain BPA. Be safe and avoid cans. Cook fresh or buy glass bottles.', '2. Soda Pop', 'Perhaps you heard about the recent study that was published in May in the American Journal of Nutrition? It found that people who consumed more than one soda per day had a higher risk of stroke than people who did not drink sodas.', 'Loaded with sugar, sodas are an empty source of calories that cause weight gain and contribute to the nationwide epidemic of obesity. Drinking large amounts of this rapidly digested sugar causes your blood sugar to spike which can lead to both inflammation and insulin resistance. Soda is often the root cause of gastro-esophageal reflux disease, which is when the contents of the stomach leak into the esophagus causing not only pain but an actual burning of the esophagus from stomach acid.', 'Although sodas are not a direct cause of ulcers, they are known to irritate and make those with ulcers have more pain. Sodas also contain artificial colorings and food chemicals like derivative 4-methylimidazole (4-MI)', 'no wonder soda pop has been shown to cause cancer.', '3. Farmed Salmon', 'Although fish sounds like one of the healthiest foods possible, farmed salmon is one you should avoid. Unfortunately, more than 60 percent of the salmon consumed in the USA is farm raised.', 'These fish are fed unnatural diets and are contaminated with chemicals, antibiotics, pesticides, and other known carcinogens. They live in very crowded conditions which results in these fish having 30 times the number of sea lice than wild salmon. Farmed salmon are fed chemicals to make their meat that reddish pink color that should occur naturally but doesn’t because of the diet of chicken litter that they are fed.', 'Also, due to their diet, they have less of the healthy omega-3 that we think we are getting when we consume fish. Studies have also shown that farmed salmon contain high levels of PCB’s, mercury, and cancer causing dioxins. Avoid farmed salmon and buy it canned or look for labels in your market that state the fish you are buying is wild sockeye salmon. ""Can you write my essay for me?"" – Yes! We offer essays from scratch across 20+ disciplines. ', '4. Processed Meats', 'What exactly are processed meats? This is a long list that includes, but is not limited to, sausages, hot dogs, bacon, most lunch meats like bologna or pimento loaf.', 'Researchers who wrote in the journal of BMC Medicine said that the excessive salts and chemicals that are used when making processed meats are damaging to your health. The study showed that 1 in every 17 people who were involved in the study died and those who ate 160 grams or more of processed meats increased their risk of early death as much as 44 percent within 12 years as opposed to those who ate 20 grams or less. This study involved people from 10 European countries and went on for almost 13 years.', 'All these processed meats contain numerous chemicals and preservatives, including sodium nitrates, which make them, look appealing and fresh but are well known carcinogens. Smoking meats seem to be particularly bad as the meat picks up tar from the smoking process. Yes, tar, the same deadly ingredient that cigarette smoke contains', '5. Microwave Popcorn', 'Those little bags of popcorn are so convenient to just stick in the microwave, you wouldn’t think for a minute that they could be dangerous to your health, but they are.', 'First, let’s talk about the bag itself. According to Wikipedia, conventional microwave popcorn bags are lined with a chemical called perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA). This is a toxin you can find in Teflon also. According to a recent study at the University of California, PFOA is linked to infertility in women. Numerous studies in lab animals and humans show that exposure to PFOA significantly increases the risk of kidney, bladder, liver, pancreas and testicular cancers.', 'Now, let’s talk about the contents. Although every manufacturer uses slightly different ingredients, most of them use soybean oil (a GMO product) as well as various preservatives such as propyl gallate, a chemical that is causes stomach problems and skin rashes. Now they don’t actually say they are using GMO corn kernels, but that’s because the government says they don’t have to. Even if they don’t use GMO corn, you can bet they aren’t using organic corn!', '6. Potato Chips', 'Yes, we know, potato chips are cheap, great tasting, quick snack, however, the negative effects they have on your body may not be worth the little bit of pleasure you derive from these crispy snacks.', 'Potato chips are high in both fat and calories, which are sure to bring on weight gain. A study done in the New England Journal of medicine found that eating just 1 once of potato chips per day caused an average 2 pound weight gain in one year. Besides being full of trans-fats which can cause high cholesterol in most people, they have excessive sodium levels which, for many people, cause high blood pressure.', 'Potato chips have artificial flavors, numerous preservatives, and colors as well, which is something else your body doesn’t need. Potato chips are fried in high temperatures to make them crispy but this also causes them to make a material called acrylamide, a known carcinogen that is also found in cigarettes.', 'It’s hard to say no to your kids demands for chips sometimes, therefore, as a sneaky alternative, buy them baked potato chips or tortilla chips which are at least lower in both fat and calories. Air popped popcorn and whole wheat pretzels are another healthier option. Or try baked apple chips or banana chips which are dehydrated. Both are crispy and are far healthier than regular potato chips.', '7. Hydrogenated oils', 'Let’s start from the point that all hydrogenated oils are vegetable oils. Vegetable oils cannot be extracted naturally like butter is, vegetable oils must be chemically removed from their source, and then they are changed to be more acceptable to consumers. They are frequently deodorized and colored to look appealing.', 'All vegetable oils contain high levels of Omega–6 fatty acids. An excess of Omega- 6 fatty acids cause health problems, such as heart disease and in increase in various cancers, especially skin cancer. You need a good balance of both Omega 3 and Omega 6. Try to get plenty of Omega 3 every day. You can do this in the form of supplements and grass fed meats, also fatty fish such as salmon and mackerel are a very good source of Omega 3.', 'Hydrogenated oils are used to preserve processed foods and keep them looking appealing for a long as possible. Hydrogenated oils influence our cell membranes’ structure and flexibility, which is linked to cancer.', '8. Foods that are highly salted, pickled, or smoked', 'Foods that are cured by use of nitrates or nitrites act as preservatives as well as adding color to the meat. Although nitrates do not cause cancer in and of themselves, under certain conditions these chemicals change once they are inside the body into N-nitroso composites. It’s this N-nitroso that is associated with a greater increase the risk of developing cancers.', 'Smoking foods such as meat or nuts causes these food items to absorb considerable amounts of the tar that smoke produces. Tar is a known carcinogen. Meats such as bacon, sausage, bologna, and salami are high in fat and salt. Pickled foods are also very high in salts.', 'There is overwhelming evidence that eating these types of foods greatly increases the risk of colorectal cancer and higher rates of stomach cancer. The rates of stomach cancer are much greater in places such as Japan where a traditional diet contains many foods that are highly salted, and/or smoked.', '9. Highly processed white flours', 'Most of you have already heard by now that white flour is not a good thing, but you most likely have no idea just how bad it really is for your health. Refining grains destroys its natural nutrients. Mills are no longer content with waiting for their flour to whiten with time', 'mills now bleach flour with a chemical called chlorine gas.', 'The EPA states that chlorine gas is a dangerous irritant that is not safe to inhale and in large quantities can be lethal. White flour lurks in many processed foods. White processed flour has a very high glycemic rate which quickly raises the blood sugar level and insulin levels, which can be a direct cause of diabetes, not to mention it is believed that it spreads cancer cells by feeding the cells directly.', 'Cancerous tumors feed mostly on the sugars in your bloodstream. By avoiding refined grains such as white flour, you can avoid, or at the very least, starve tumors.', '10. GMO’s', 'Genetically modified organisms, more commonly called GMO’s, are foods that have been modified by chemicals and grown with chemicals.', 'In a study done by Dr. Pusztai at the Rowett Institute in Scotland, rats were fed GMO foods, especially potatoes. ALL rats showed damaged immune systems, pre-cancerous cell growths, along with smaller brains and livers, in just the first 10 days of the project. American consumers believe that the FDA has approved these GMO foods and this is simply not the case.', 'The FDA has NO testing procedures for GMO foods, NONE. The only human study ever published showed that those foreign genes that are present in GM food transfer to the DNA in the bacteria in our digestive systems. We, the American consumer, are the guinea pig (or rat) in this case. Unfortunately, almost all grains, including soybeans, wheat, and corn, have been grown via GMO’s.', 'GMO’s do not have to be listed on food labels, so read carefully and look for labels that state the food is GMO free.', '11. Refined Sugars', 'Refined sugars are not only known to spike insulin levels, but also to be the most preferable food for cancer cells, thus promoting their growth.', 'Cancers seem to have a sweet tooth. This is a known fact that has been around for many years. The Nobel laureate in medicine, German Otto Warburg, back in 1931, first discovered that tumors and cancers both use sugars to ""feed"" themselves and/or to increase in size. In order to proliferate, cancer cells seem to prefer feeding on fructose-rich sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)', 'the reason is that HFCS is being metabolized by cancer cells most quickly and easily.', 'Now it is clear why high-fructose corn syrup is considered the worst offender. And since cakes, pies, cookies, sodas, juices, sauces, cereals, and many other extremely popular, mostly processed, food items are loaded with refined sugars and HFCS in particular, this helps explain why cancer rates are on the rise these days.']",1

After all, those who concentrated their money in U.S. tech stocks back in the late 1990s had an exhilarating run for a few years.

Across the country, thousands of firearms were seized over the last few years — many more than in other Western European countries.', ""Many of the recent major terror attacks in Europe were planned in Belgium's capital, Brussels, where police have raided dozens of homes belonging to suspected Islamic State sympathizers or other militants. Experts, however, say that only a fraction of all illicit firearms which circulate in the small European country were found."", '""What authorities focus on is gaining some time,"" said Duquet. ""The aim is to make sure that terrorists need extra steps to obtain a gun — for instance, one week. Every additional day you win is an extra day for authorities to intervene.""', ""Most trafficking takes place on land routes, rather than on ships or planes. Criminals involved in the trafficking business enter the European Union's Schengen area, where there are few border checks, through E.U. members Slovenia or Croatia."", 'So how easy is it to cross the border into the Schengen area? A look at the chart below helps explain the answer: very easy, in most cases. So far, few E.U. citizens are thoroughly screened while entering the Schengen zone from outside. While non-E. U. citizens are frequently asked to stop and have their vehicles searched, E.U. citizens are mostly allowed to pass.', 'This explains why the vast majority of those involved in firearms trafficking on European Union soil are citizens of the union. Many come from Southern Europe.', 'Although the vast majority of weapons smugglers are young, between 20 and 34, there is also a surprising number of older criminals who earn money from the business.', 'The mixed profiles of those offering illicit firearms in Europe is matched by an increasingly diverse demand for the weapons on offer.', '""Ten years ago you wouldn\'t have found Kalashnikovs in Western Europe,"" said Duquet, referring to an assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union and now widely copied around the world. Tens of thousands of those weapons still circulate in the Balkans, where war still raged two decades ago. Many of those weapons are now making their way to Western Europe, often smuggled in small quantities.', '""For criminals, Kalashnikovs are not that interesting. You can\'t really rob a store with it,"" said Duquet. ""But for terrorists, Kalashnikovs are ideal. They kill many people in a short time frame.""']",1
"[""5 potential names for Las Vegas' new NHL franchise""]","['Breaking down five potential franchise names for the NHL’s Las Vegas expansion.', 'NHL hockey appears to be officially headed to Las Vegas as Sin City has been approved to become the league’s 31st franchise according to the Associated Press. This landmark decision gives Las Vegas its first major professional sports franchise after years of trying to break through the stigma associated with the city in order to land a pro sports team to add to the lengthy list of entertainment options in the tourist capital of the United States.', 'Now that Vegas has an NHL team to call their own, it will need a team name. Something that will create plenty of fun debate as to what would be the most fitting name for a team playing in the Sin City. Should they make a tongue in cheek ode to their gambling reputation? Or should they go with a new identity with a name that distances itself from the reputation of Vegas as being the city of vices?', 'There are plenty of directions in which the NHL’s newest franchise could go with when it comes to a team name, but on the day of the news that Vegas will be the newest home of pro hockey we have five names that should be considered for the league’s 31st team.', '5. T-Mobile Las Vegas', 'With the NHL adding more corporate sponsorship than ever, there is an opportunity for the league to sell the naming rights of a franchise that will have to pay a $500 million expansion fee. With T-Mobile looking like the perfect fit to be the first company to own naming rights to a sports franchise to play in the already named T-Mobile Arena.', 'The telecom giants already have a long history of corporate sponsorship in sports as Bundesliga champions FC Bayern have their kits sponsored by T-Mobile so the opportunity to have the naming rights for an entire team would be an opportunity that would definitely interest the company.', 'The only question is if the NHL are willing to upset the traditionalist in order to create an instant revenue stream for its newest franchise.', 'Basketball and hockey teams in Europe being named after corporate sponsors is nothing new as T-Mobile own the naming rights to the Basketball Bundesliga team in Bonn, Germany, but with the backlash surrounding ads on NBA and NHL jerseys this idea could be a hard sell even if it would be a nice cash injection to get the Vegas franchise going in terms of creating revenue.', 'That being said, there is already an American team doing this and it hasn’t hurt them at all... the New York Red Bulls, as in the energy drink.', 'Don’t expect the naming rights of the NHL franchise to be sold, but if the league is open to the idea there would be no better fit than T-Mobile to step in.', '4. Las Vegas Ice Rebels', 'This name would be a direct tie-in to UNLV, which is the city’s most famous non-gambling institution and will be a key demographic that the NHL will be trying to lure to the T-Mobile Arena once the team opens up operations in the coming years.', 'The Runnin’ Rebels are Vegas’ team as without pro sports, the UNLV basketball program in the 80s and 90s brought the city their only major championship in 1990 when they won the National Championship. Since then, the Rebels have been the toast of the town even if their football and basketball programs haven’t found the same success. A built-in fanbase that the NHL could associate with by making a nod to the university with the Ice Rebels name.', 'There could be objections made by the university for infringing upon their school’s marketing, but with Vegas sports being so closely associated with UNLV it would be fitting that the first major pro sports franchise in the city would also carry the Rebels name proudly onto the ice.', 'There is a bit of precedent here as well, the University of Texas at Arlington lent their Mavericks mascot to an NBA expansion franchise in nearby Dallas.', '3. Las Vegas Outlaws', 'Another ode to former sports franchises, the Outlaws existed briefly in Las Vegas as both an XFL as well as Arena Football franchise. Both times only lasting a single season in Vegas before folding in 2001 with Vince McMahon’s failed XFL league and the AFL Outlaws folding due to poor attendance after their lone season in 2015.', 'While the Outlaws name is most recently associated with former Motley Crüe frontman Vince Neil’s failed AFL franchise, the XFL Outlaws managed to draw 22,000 fans per game and most notably had ""He Hate Me"" Rod Smart on their roster during that one fateful summer where the XFL existed briefly on NBC.', 'Naming the team the Outlaws would be a good way to tie in the identity of Las Vegas as well as to touch on its sporting history without directly associating with a current franchise or with gambling. The only real drawback would be naming a franchise after two teams that only managed to last a single season in Las Vegas before ultimately folding.', '2. Las Vegas Aces', 'This name will be a big favorite as it seems like a natural way to tie-in Vegas casinos with the new NHL franchise. Something that the NHL may or may not want to do as Gary Bettman has been on the record stating that he does not approve of sports betting on his league, something that may or may not also extend to his league being associated with casino gaming.', 'Now that the NHL is in Vegas, Bettman is likely to be singing a different tune when it comes to legal gambling when he will be looking for corporate sponsorships so the Aces name should definitely be on the table if it is floated around. And it should be floated around as it seems to be a no-brainer to name the team after something related to its poker/blackjack playing history.', 'We will have to see if the NHL approves of such associations with Vegas’ casinos, but with the aforementioned need to draw sponsorship money from them an easy way to build an early relationship would be by directly tying the casinos to the team with a name like the Aces.', '1. Las Vegas Wranglers', 'This name is a straight ode to Vegas’ professional hockey history as the former Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL were in existence from 2003-2014, bringing minor hockey to the Sin City in the third tier league to the NHL/AHL.', 'A former ECHL affiliate of the Calgary Flames and the Phoenix Coyotes, the Wranglers did successful business in the city for over a decade before their lease at the Orleans Arena forced the franchise to fold. Their Wikipedia page citing that they were given the ""Best Local Sports Team"" award by the Las Vegas Review-Journal on three separate occasions during their run in Vegas. Producing a handful of NHL role players along the way as a team that was always a fixture in the ECHL Playoffs.', 'Naming a team after a now defunct minor league team might be a tough sell, but the Wranglers are one of few historic names that could be considered for the new NHL franchise and is a name that has little ties to the gambling presence that commissioner Gary Bettman has historically had a problem with. Based on the Wranglers mostly successful run in the city before recently folding, it would be a nice homage to a team that brought hockey to the Sin City first by naming the new team after the former ECHL franchise.']",1

"['What Archaeologists Discovered on This 1,500-Year-Old Mummy’s Feet Is Blowing People’s Minds']","['Finding a well-preserved 1,500-year-old mummy buried in the middle of nowhere would generally already be considered a major success. But in this case, rather than the discovery itself, it’s what the corpse was found with on its feet that’s really getting people flushed with excitement.', 'Interestingly, this mummy would never have been discovered if it hadn’t been for the help of local herders. When the herdsmen ran across a strange burial site in the mountains of western Mongolia, they alerted a museum in the nearby town of Khovd.', 'As a result, a team of archaeologists went to investigate. The burial site is located at 9,200 feet in elevation along the Altai Mountains of Central Asia – among the most sparsely populated regions in the world.', 'Inside the ancient 10-foot-deep grave, the archaeologists found a well-preserved mummy alongside a number of items, including a saddle, a wooden bowl, a clay vase, an iron kettle and traditional Mongolian clothing. The grave even contained the remains of a horse.', 'The archaeologists also uncovered wool, from both sheep and camels, in the grave. And thanks to all the extra items, the specialists were able to date the corpse to approximately the 6th century CE, making it just about 1,500 years old.', 'Because they did not find a bow or any arrows in the grave, the archaeologists assume that the mummified remains are those of a woman. The body itself is tightly wrapped in felt cloth.', 'Judging from her possessions, she was likely ""not from the elite"" of her tribe, said B.Sukhbaatar, one of the museum’s researchers. That said, she was Turkic, and her grave is, furthermore, the first complete Turkic burial site ever discovered in Mongolia.', 'The Turkic people first emerged in the Altai region thousands of years ago before migrating out to many other places, including modern-day Turkey. Ancient 6th-century Chinese texts describe the Turkic people as strong and powerful nomads, skilled in archery and horseback riding.', 'Indeed, the individual in the grave was clearly part of a group of people who relied almost entirely on livestock to support their way of life. Other discovered items that confirm this idea include sheep and goat bones and leather – parts of grazing animals, which the nomads would have had accompany them on their travels.', 'The amazing find may also be the first complete Turkic grave unearthed not just in Mongolia but all of Central Asia. And, interestingly, the archaeologists credit the body’s preservation to the cold temperatures of the mountainous region.', 'Similar findings of Turkic warrior graves have been made in the Altai region in recent years. However, this is the first such site to contain so many personal possessions.', 'But despite the incredible find, there’s more that has the internet buzzing. The most interesting aspect of the mummy is its strange footwear, which instantly generated a heated discussion when the photos first appeared on the popular video sharing website LiveLeak on April 10, 2016.', 'The mummy’s shoes feature colored stripes which, as many commenters pointed out, look strangely similar to the Adidas logo. Others on Twitter and Facebook took the theory a step further by suggesting that the woman was a time traveler – and we’d have to add that she must have been one with a great sense of sporty footwear fashion.', 'Another person quipped, ""I wish my adidas shoes last 1500 years I’m lucky if I get 3 months out of them."" But, naturally, this was all meant to be tongue-in-cheek', 'as another commenter pointed out, the shoes actually had some clear differences from typical Adidas footwear.', 'For one thing, the shoes feature four visible stripes, whereas Adidas has only three. And of course their owner probably fashioned the shoes herself – rather than having them made in Vietnam. Others chimed in that the stripes were more likely bands used to hold the shoes in place.', 'In any case, the fact that the archaeologists have not responded to the footwear debate suggests that they don’t take it very seriously, unfortunately. To them, the find holds much more value as a window into the life of 6th-century Central Asian nomads.', 'Mr. Sukhbaatar said the discovery is a ""very rare phenomenon,"" adding, ""These finds show us the beliefs and rituals of Turkiks."" He suggests that the horse in the grave was likely sacrificed to continue serving its master in the afterlife.', 'In similar fashion to the Ancient Egyptians, these Turkic people believed that physical items could be used in the afterlife. This explains why the woman was buried together with her possessions and especially her horse.', 'But more importantly, the sophisticated items found in the grave ""show us that these people were very skilled craftsmen,"" Sukhbaatar added. ""Given that this was the grave of a simple person, we understand that craft skills were rather well developed.""', 'The archaeological specialists hope to gain further insights once the mummy has been unwrapped and properly examined. At the very least, they will be able to give a better final determination on the mummy’s gender. A sense of mystery certainly surrounds this ancient discovery, but it’s perhaps less to do with footwear than some folks would like to imagine.']",1

Critics, when asked to rate it out of 10, gave it a measly 2.6, and general audiences gave it an even lower 2.2. ""Sometimes it’s surprising how stupid moviemakers think we are,"" John Wilson, founder of the Razzie Awards, which celebrates the worst movies every year, says.

Bad-movies aficionado Emer Prevost, who runs the YouTube channel ""Reaction & Review,"" says that Ballistic won’t cut it, though, as a cult movie. It takes a special kind of bad to also be entertaining. ""I took the DVD down to a local shop the next day. They said they could give me 60 cents for it. I said, ‘Good. Take it,’"" Prevost says.', 'Of course, Ballistic probably won’t get to keep its place in bad movie history forever. Every year, the Razzies choose new terrible movies. Look back through time and the epitome of worst movie has changed as consistently as Ballistic’s characters’ motivations. Tastes differ on what’s not just bad but horrendous: Some say The Room is the worst; others, Plan 9 From Outer Space. And in all fairness, not everyone despises it. Critic Michelle Alexandria says, ""I don’t watch action films for story or even acting. A good action film only has to deliver on the action for me."" So maybe make that 115 out of 116 critics.

He dedicates his new book ""to all my Carabinieri bodyguards. To the fifty-one thousand hours we’ve spent together and to those still ahead.""', 'His movement may have been curtailed, but not his anger or ambition. His latest book, ""Zero Zero Zero"", is an exploration of the global cocaine trade, from the foothills of the Andes to the nightclubs of Europe. It is a well-trodden trail, but the book provides a useful overview of the industry, explaining the incongruous mix of co-operation and cruelty in each link of the supply chain.', 'Cocaine-trafficking is risky but enormously profitable. As Mr Saviano points out, a kilo of the drug costing $1,500 in Colombia fetches $12,000-$16,000 in Mexico and $77,000 if it makes it to Britain. According to the accountant of Colombia’s Medellín drug mob, the group was trafficking 15 tonnes of cocaine into America every day in the 1980s. Thirty years later, the figures are still staggering. In Italy the Calabrian ’Ndrangheta has now overtaken the Sicilian Cosa Nostra as the country’s most powerful mafia group. It turns over an estimated €53 billion ($59 billion) a year, almost half of which comes from drug-trafficking.', 'The book does a fine job of tracing the international co-operation required to get the drug to market. In Colombia, producers struck distribution deals with their Mexican counterparts after American authorities grew adept at intercepting their cocaine shipments. In exchange for a large chunk of the profits, the Mexicans agreed to move the drugs across the border. Alliances have also been formed with groups from further away. The Russian mafia supplies Latin American gangs with Soviet-era weapons. West African government officials store drug shipments off the coast.', 'In an often grisly series of passages, Mr Saviano details some of the murderous national rivalries that occasionally make the front pages. In 2006 Mexico was plunged into violence when the president, Felipe Calderón, declared war on the drug gangs by sending 6,500 troops to the troubled state of Michoacán. Over 47,000 people were killed by violence associated with organised crime between 2006 and 2011, says the government. In the first six years of the drug war 31 Mexican mayors were killed, 13 of them in 2010 alone.', 'The most vivid sections are those describing the industry’s countless victims: the young man from Guinea-Bissau who spends a flight to Lisbon praying that the 60 capsules of cocaine in his stomach will not burst; the Colombian beauty queen whose husband has disappeared; the American undercover agent who is tortured to death when his cover is blown, his body dumped beside a Mexican road.', 'Structurally, the book is a bit of a mess. Lacking a coherent narrative, it is more a collection of articles, lurching from one topic to another. The effect is often disorientating and sometimes offputting. A chapter on Los Zetas, a ferocious group of Mexican traffickers composed of former soldiers, is followed, inexplicably, by a syrupy poem about cocaine. Better editing would have made for an easier read.', 'Despite its shortcomings, the book lands a resounding thump to the solar plexus. Taken as a whole, it is an angry rebuke to all those—traffickers and politicians alike—who perpetuate the violence. ""I want to scream this loud enough so that people will know,"" writes Mr Saviano. His rage, both at his own predicament and that of other victims, is palpable. ""As terrible as it may seem, total legalisation may be the only answer,"" he concludes. By reminding readers of the senseless suffering wrought by the cocaine trade, this book makes a powerful case for a new approach.']",1

The forum did end up focusing largely on sexual violence, nonetheless, Naples said.', ""Naples said there has been significant movement to address students' concerns around sexual misconduct in the past year, but more needs to be done."", '""As an individual faculty member, I can say that I do think there have been many missteps regarding the handling of sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus,"" Naples said, ""both in terms of coordination of responses and insensitivity of first responders.""', ""Naples said the WGSS faculty's efforts to address on sexual violence pre-date the complaint and lawsuit, and vowed they will continue after the legal grievances are resolved."", '""I still feel like they don\'t want to say it\'s a problem here, and they don\'t want to talk about it,"" Carrier said.

['What are the five most addictive substances on Earth?'],"['What are the most addictive drugs? This question seems simple, but the answer depends on whom you ask. From the points of view different researchers, the potential for a drug to be addictive can be judged in terms of the harm it causes, the street value of the drug, the extent to which the drug activates the brain’s dopamine system , how pleasurable people report the drug to be, the degree to which the drug causes withdrawal symptoms, and how easily a person trying the drug will become hooked.', 'There are other facets to measuring the addictive potential of a drug, too, and there are even researchers who argue that no drug is always addictive. Given the varied view of researchers, then, one way of ranking addictive drugs is to ask expert panels. In 2007, David Nutt and his colleagues asked addiction experts to do exactly that – with some interesting findings.', '5. Nicotine', 'Nicotine is the main addictive ingredient of tobacco. When somebody smokes a cigarette, nicotine is rapidly absorbed by the lungs and delivered to the brain. While Nutt et al’s expert panels rated nicotine (tobacco) as only the 12th most addictive substance, there are reasons to believe that nicotine is a very powerful addictive drug.', '4. Barbiturates (‘downers’)', 'Barbiturates – also known as blue bullets, gorillas, nembies, barbs and pink ladies – are a class of drugs that were initially used to treat anxiety and to induce sleep . They interfere with chemical signalling in the brain, the effect of which is to shut down various brain regions. At low doses, barbiturates cause euphoria, but at higher doses they can be lethal because they suppress breathing. Barbiturate dependence was common when the drugs were easily available by prescription, but this has declined dramatically as other drugs have replaced them. This highlights the role that the context plays in addiction: if an addictive drug is not widely available, it can do little harm. Nutt et al’s expert panels rated barbiturates as the fourth most addictive substance.', '3. Cocaine', 'Crack cocaine has been ranked by experts as being the third most damaging drug and powdered cocaine, which causes a milder high, as the fifth most damaging. About 21% of people who try cocaine will become dependent on it at sometime in their life. Cocaine is similar to other addictive stimulants, such as methamphetamine – which is becoming more of a problem as it becomes more widely available – and amphetamine.', '2. Alcohol', 'Although legal in the US and UK, alcohol was rated as the second most addictive substance by Nutt et al.’s experts (scoring 2.2 out of a maximum of 3). Alcohol has many effects on the brain, but in laboratory experiments on animals it increased dopamine levels in the brain’s reward system by 40-360% – and the more the animals drank the more dopamine levels increased.', '1. Heroin', 'Nutt et al.’s experts ranked heroin as the most addictive drug, giving it a score of 2.5 out of a maximum score of 3. Heroin is an opiate that causes the level of dopamine in the brain’s reward system to increase by up to 200% in experimental animals . In addition to being arguably the most addictive drug, heroin is dangerous, too, because the dose that can cause death is only five times greater than the dose required for a high.']",1

At 6\'6"", the guard had size and ball-handling skill comparable to Magic Johnson, along with speed, athleticism and scoring ability believed to challenge the great Michael Jordan. In a modern era where tall, well-rounded wing players are increasingly common, Hardaway was the original. During his time with the Orlando Magic, Hardaway looked poised to take over the league as the four-time All-Star quickly established himself as one of the premiere talents in the Eastern Conference along with then teammate and rising star, Shaquille O\'Neal. His well-rounded game made him a shoo-in for the 1996 U.S. Olympic Team, and there he won a gold medal. Advertisement Ultimately, despite his success in Orlando, a nearly career-ending knee injury put him on ice for the 1997-1998 NBA season and would eventually send him to the Phoenix Suns. However, to lend credence to just how special a player Hardaway was, he got a seven-year contract worth $86 million, despite coming off of an injury that would likely derail most modern-day careers for good.He would never fully return to his peak, retiring in 2007. Off the court, Hardaway\'s campaign with Nike was one of the most successful, birthing some of the most popular sneakers of the 1990s, the Foamposite . In addition to his famed partnership with Nike, Hardaway also had various lucrative endeavors ranging from a salon and barbershop to a celebrity fitness center, Terf Athletic Facility, in Miami. Needless to say, Hardaway, who according to CNN , ""made more than $120 million in a pro basketball career that spanned 16 seasons,"" is pretty much set for life financially. So why is it that he would return to his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., to, of all things, coach a middle school basketball team? He did it for his friend Desmond Merriweather, who above all else, wanted to ensure that his boys would have a coach while he battled colon cancer. Merriweather sadly passed on Feb. 8 , but with the help of Hardaway his dream was fulfilled.']",1

Meanwhile, people with inherited color blindness are more likely to experience color vision abnormalities with red and green.', 'While the study did not look at causes of the abnormal color vision, the researchers noted some possible reasons could include yellowing of the eye lens and smaller pupil size (which would then lead to less light coming in to the eye), as well as increased rates of age-related eye diseases, such as glaucoma.']",1

['Here’s what happens if you take the morning-after pill all the time'],"['Let’s get to the bottom of this, once and for all.', '1. The morning-after pill is a form of emergency contraception that can prevent pregnancy when taken after having unprotected sex.', 'It comes in a few different forms, but the morning-after pill most often refers to Plan B One-Step (and generics like Next Choice One Dose), which can be purchased over the counter. It’s a single pill with a high dose of levonorgestrel, the same progestin hormone found in many birth control pills, and it can be used up to 72 hours (three days) after unprotected sex.', 'Another pill option is Ella, or ulipristal acetate, which can be used up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex, but it requires a prescription. Both Plan B and Ella primarily work by delaying ovulation, and they may in some cases also work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.', 'Although we’ll focus on the pills in this article, it’s worth mentioning that the copper IUD can also be used as an emergency contraceptive. It’s extremely effective if inserted within five days of unprotected sex and offers pregnancy protection for up to 10 years.', '2. FYI: The morning-after pill is not the same as the abortion pill.', 'Emergency contraception pills like Plan B and Ella will not terminate an existing pregnancy. It’s not the same as the abortion pill, otherwise known as a medical abortion, where a person takes a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol to terminate an early pregnancy.', '3. Since the morning-after pill is really meant for emergencies, you might be wondering if it’s harmful to take it too often.', 'BuzzFeed Health reached out to two experts to find out: Dr. Alyssa Dweck, board-certified OB-GYN, author of The Complete A to Z for Your V; and Dr. Lauren Streicher, associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s medical school, and author of Sex Rx.', '4. First let’s start with Ella, the prescription-only morning-after pill. This one should not be taken more than once per menstrual cycle.', 'Ella has a different active ingredient than Plan B, and according to its website, it shouldn’t be taken more than once per menstrual cycle. ""I would say repeated use of Ella has not been well-studied and is not recommended,"" says Streicher.', 'Additionally, using Ella with hormonal birth control pills can reduce the effectiveness of both preventing pregnancy, so you should wait at least five days after taking Ella to resume your birth control.', 'But because Ella requires a doctor’s visit and prescription, you’d probably have to jump through a lot of hoops to take it frequently. So aside from it not being recommended, repeated use of Ella would also take up a lot of your time and money. So...just don’t do it.', '5. On the other hand, taking Plan B is basically like taking a ton of birth control at once. And it isn’t going to hurt you if you take it multiple times.', 'Actually, the morning-after pill is even safer and more tolerable than taking a ton of birth control because it only contains levonorgestrel, whereas most birth control pills also have estrogen. ""In the past, women who needed emergency contraception would just take a super-high dose of birth control, but the estrogen just caused a lot of nausea and vomiting,"" Dweck tells BuzzFeed Health.', 'So they made one pill with fewer side effects but enough hormones to still prevent pregnancy. ""It’s very safe and well-tolerated, even in women who aren’t able to take some birth control pills because of clotting disorders,"" says Dweck.', 'Even if you take it while you’re already on hormonal birth control — for example, after missing more than three pills and having unprotected sex — it’s still safe. ""It’s not going to harm you — it’s really just a little extra progesterone on top of the birth control,"" Dweck says.', '6. Obviously, though, taking such a high dose of hormones could cause irregular bleeding and mess with your menstrual cycle — which isn’t ideal.', '""About 16% of women report side effects like nausea, vomiting, or irregular bleeding,"" says Dweck. But the main downside is that it can cause a lot of menstrual irregularity. Depending on how often you take the morning-after pill, it can throw off your cycle for weeks or even months, says Streicher. And a messed-up cycle can make it harder to prevent pregnancy if you aren’t using another method like condoms.', '""You never know for sure when you are ovulating, even less so if you have taken a big dose of hormones that may interfere with your normal cycle,"" Streicher says. So you should always remember to use a backup barrier method when you’re having sex after taking emergency contraception.', 'Plus, it’s a lot of unnecessary hormones when you just could be on a more reliable, low-dose method. For instance, if you have unprotected sex 20 times in one month (and take Plan B 20 times in one month), that’s a lot of progestin to take as opposed to taking a small, regular dose every day — not to mention a lot of spotting or bleeding.', '7. But there’s no evidence that repeated use of Plan B will cause permanent damage to your reproductive organs or cause infertility.', '""It’s a very safe drug, and taking it multiple times won’t kill you or cause any permanent damage, infertility, or even blood clots,"" Dweck says. So no, there are really no long-term implications of regularly using the morning-after pill.', '""We know that hormones in emergency contraceptives, which are just a different dosage of the same ones found in birth control pills, have no impact on fertility whatsoever,"" says Streicher. So it’s best not to panic or stress if you’ve taken it many times or point to that as a cause of any fertility issues down the road.', '8. So why do the experts still advise against using Plan B regularly? Because it simply isn’t as effective as other birth control methods.', 'Unlike more reliable methods, the morning-after pill’s effectiveness decreases the longer you wait to take it after unprotected sex, says Streicher. According to Plan B’s prescribing information, it helps prevent nearly 7 out of 8 potential pregnancies (about 87%), but other studies on levonorgestrel have found the effectiveness can vary from 52–100%.', 'Compared with the efficacy of other birth control methods, this isn’t really your best bet for pregnancy prevention. For instance, long-acting methods like the IUD and implant are both over 99% effective. Combined birth control pills are also over 99% effective with perfect use or 91% effective with typical use.', '""So you really have a higher chance of getting pregnant if the morning-after pill is your primary birth control,"" says Dweck.', '9. What can increase your risk of infertility is all the unprotected (so, without a condom) sex you have before taking the morning-after pill.', '""Frequent unprotected sex means you’re more likely to get an STI, and we know that untreated STIs impact fertility and ovarian function,"" says Streicher. And it’s easy for STIs to go untreated when many of them have no symptoms at all.', 'The number one cause of infertility is age, but the number one preventable cause of infertility is actually untreated chlamydia — which can also cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), potentially fatal ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain.', '""Even if taking emergency contraception frequently doesn’t cause harm, it could still technically be harmful if it means you’re having a lot of unprotected sex and exposing yourself to STIs,"" Dweck says.', '10. Finally, emergency contraception can get pricey — up to $50 a pop — so frequent use will cost you a lot of money.', '""It’s a very, very expensive way to provide contraception and there are so many better, cheaper options,"" says Streicher. For instance, Plan B sold over the counter at most pharmacies and grocery stores usually costs about $50 per pill, with generics usually priced around $40 (but we also recently found it on Seamless for almost $70).', 'So depending on how often you take it, you could be spending hundreds of dollars each month, and that’s for a product that’s less effective than other options.', '11. There’s definitely a time and place for the morning-after pill, but it’s not the most effective or affordable option for reliable birth control.', 'The morning-after pill is an amazing drug, Dweck says, and it exists because there are situations where it is necessary or the right option for some women.', '""But it still shouldn’t be used on a regular basis, because we have so many reliable forms of birth control that cause fewer side effects, cost less, and that are more effective at preventing pregnancy,"" Dweck says.', 'If you’re on birth control pills but still take emergency contraception occasionally because you missed a few pills or your pack looks like a game of Connect 4, you might want to consider a long-acting method like the IUD or implant.', 'Remember, the ~right~ birth control option will vary from person to person, so talk to your doctor about your unique lifestyle and contraceptive needs, and they’ll help you find something that works for you.', '12. And if you’ve already taken the morning-after pill a handful of times, don’t stress or worry that you’ve caused long-term damage — it’s totally safe.']",1

For more than a decade, professional snoops have been able to search troves of public and nonpublic records—known addresses, DMV records, photographs of a person’s car—and condense them into comprehensive reports costing as little as $10. Now they can combine that information with the kinds of things marketers know about you, such as which politicians you donate to, what you spend on groceries, and whether it’s weird that you ate in last night, to create a portrait of your life and predict your behavior.', 'IDI, a year-old company in the so-called data-fusion business, is the first to centralize and weaponize all that information for its customers. The Boca Raton, Fla., company’s database service, idiCORE, combines public records with purchasing, demographic, and behavioral data. Chief Executive Officer Derek Dubner says the system isn’t waiting for requests from clients—it’s already built a profile on every American adult, including young people who wouldn’t be swept up in conventional databases, which only index transactions. ""We have data on that 21-year-old who’s living at home with mom and dad,"" he says.', 'Dubner declined to provide a demo of idiCORE or furnish the company’s report on me. But he says these personal profiles include all known addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses; every piece of property ever bought or sold, plus related mortgages; past and present vehicles owned; criminal citations, from speeding tickets on up; voter registration; hunting permits; and names and phone numbers of neighbors. The reports also include photos of cars taken by private companies using automated license plate readers—billions of snapshots tagged with GPS coordinates and time stamps to help PIs surveil people or bust alibis.', 'IDI also runs two coupon websites, allamericansavings.com and samplesandsavings.com, that collect purchasing and behavioral data. When I signed up for the latter, I was asked for my e-mail address, birthday, and home address, information that could easily link me with my idiCORE profile. The site also asked if I suffered from arthritis, asthma, diabetes, or depression, ostensibly to help tailor its discounts.', 'Users and industry analysts say the addition of purchasing and behavioral data to conventional data fusion outmatches rival systems in terms of capabilities—and creepiness.

The Federal Trade Commission oversees the industry, but PI companies are largely expected to police themselves, because a midsize outfit may run thousands of searches a month.', 'Dubner says most Americans have little to fear. As examples, he cites idiCORE uses such as locating a missing person and nabbing a fraud or terrorism suspect.', 'IDI, like much of the data-fusion industry, traces its lineage to Hank Asher, a former cocaine smuggler and self-taught programmer who began fusing sets of public data from state and federal governments in the early 1990s.

In May 2015, after a flurry of purchases and mergers, the group rebranded its database venture as IDI.', 'Besides pitching its databases to big-name PIs (Kroll, Control Risks), law firms, debt collectors, and government agencies, IDI says it’s also targeting consumer marketers.

It declined to provide more recent figures. The company’s data sets are growing, too. In December, Frost helped underwrite IDI’s $100 million acquisition of marketing profiler Fluent, which says it has 120 million profiles of U.S. consumers. In June, IDI bought ad platform Q Interactive for a reported $21 million in stock.', 'IDI may need Frost’s deep pockets for a while.

"[""Here's how often cops are arrested for breaking the laws they're paid to uphold""]","['A new study finds that hundreds of police officers are arrested each year for the same sorts of crimes they are supposed to be thwarting.', 'The study, believed to be the first of its kind, was conducted by researchers at Bowling Green State University and funded by the National Institute of Justice, which released the report this month. Researchers identified 6,724 cases involving the arrests of 5,545 sworn officers across the nation between 2005 and 2011.', 'That means that on average, police officers are getting arrested around 1,000 times per year.', 'Alarmingly, forty-one percent of the total crimes were committed while on duty. Philip Stinson, lead researcher on the study and BGSU professor, told The Huffington Post that even when off-duty, some of these officers committed crimes using powers endowed to them as sworn members of law enforcement or knowledge gained through their authority as police officers -- thereby making the distinction murky in some cases.', '""Police officers can’t seem to turn it off at night,"" Stinson said.', 'The alleged crimes cops were arrested for most frequently were simple assault, driving under the influence and aggravated assault. Altogether, those crimes made up one-third of the total cases. There were also a considerable number of sex crimes cases, including forcible fondling and forcible rape -- about 10 percent of all cases -- and, disturbingly, the sex crimes cases included some victims under the age of 18. While the victims were mostly female, there were some male victims as well, Stinson said Thursday during a web conference detailing the report.', '""Our first and perhaps most salient general observation about the data was that police crimes are not uncommon and that they occur with some regularity in jurisdictions across the nation,"" the report reads. ""The sheer number of police crimes directly contradicts the presumption that they are perpetrated by a small cadre of problem-prone officers.""', 'Stinson and his co-authors broke the cases of arrest into five broad categories:', 'sex-related police crime (1,475 arrest cases of 1,070 sworn officers)', 'alcohol-related police crime (1,405 arrest cases of 1,283 sworn officers)', 'drug-related police crime (739 arrest cases of 665 sworn officers)', 'violence-related police crime (3,328 arrest cases of 2,586 sworn officers', 'profit-motivated police crime (1,592 cases of 1,396 officers)', 'Male police were arrested at a far higher rate than female officers: Almost 95 percent of police crimes were committed by males.', ""About 72 percent of arrest cases resulted in convictions, Stinson said. Still, only about half of the total cases ultimately resulted in job loss for the arrested officers. The reasons for that are complex, the researchers noted, but in part, professional discipline may be lacking following an officer's arrest because their own department may not know about the crime committed. That's because about two-thirds of all the cases originated from arrests made by a police department that didn't employ the officer arrested, meaning, in at least some cases, police departments may not be aware that some of their own officers are committing crimes."", 'Stinson and his colleagues say there are several things that law enforcement agencies can do to help keep cops from breaking the law. For example, they could perform annual criminal background checks for their sworn officers, and have written policies in place that specify standards for responding to police officers being arrested. They also could adopt policies compelling mandatory disclosure whenever an officer is arrested for a crime or when the agency issues an order of protection against the officer.', 'Because the researches also found instances of mental illness in some of the cases, as well as officers experiencing an ""unraveling of their lives"" following their arrest, they say agencies should install early warning systems to track officer arrests. That way, the officers can be referred to employee assistance programs when appropriate.', 'The full number of police officer crimes is likely higher than what the BGSU researchers found. The researchers used media reports to determine when an officer was arrested, so any crimes committed by an officer not reported by a law enforcement agency or discovered by a news organization are not included in the data.', '""We know that, as a general matter, crime is underreported,"" David Harris, a professor of law at University of Pittsburgh School of Law who studies policing, told HuffPost. ""Some types are underreported much more than others. There is no reason to think this would not be true with crimes by police.""', 'Harris also noted there is evidence that police officers are reluctant to report misconduct by fellow officers and that some agencies tend not to take seriously any complaints of misconduct, criminal or otherwise. Those factors may also contribute to a lower rate.', 'Given the limitations of the data available, Jonathan Blanks, a researcher with Cato’s National Police Misconduct Reporting Project, said the absolute number of crimes committed by police is likely ""unknowable."" He outlined some of the reasons why on Thursday in a blog post about the new report:', 'We find cases where officers are arrested and convicted of crimes. But we also find officers who are given ""professional courtesy"" and not arrested for drunk driving. We see cases in which officers plea down their violent and disturbing felony cases to misdemeanor disorderly conduct, which allows them to maintain their peace officers’ license. We find longstanding criminal conspiracies that sometimes take years to uncover. And, just today in Baltimore, we see prosecutors unable to convict the officer believed to be most culpable for the conduct that resulted in the death of Freddie Gray. It is impossible to gauge the extent of misconduct because we don’t know how much of it the police and the media are catching.', ""There are are roughly 750,000 sworn local and state law enforcement officers in the U.S., according to a recent count by the Department of Justice, and Stinson's data estimates the rate of arrest for officers during the years of his study is 1.7 cops per 100,000 people. As a comparison, the approximate rate of arrest of civilians in the U.S. is around 3,888 per 100,000 people, according to FBI Uniform Crime Report data. The vast difference in those rates may lead some to diminish the importance of the report's findings. But Stinson says comparing the two rates is missing the larger point of the research: Government agents whose duty it is to uphold the law should not be breaking the law."", '""Police officers should not be getting arrested,"" Stinson said. ""Yes, the rates of arrest are very low. But, this stuff is nuts. And the fact that officers are arrested for so many different types of crimes is simply amazing to me.""', 'Stinson argues the data points toward a set of issues related to ""the process of police socialization and the deep police subculture"" that demand further scrutiny.']",1

Helium-filled balloons can reach several miles above the Earth's surface, but they cannot float into space (if they could, that'd just mean more space junk we'd have to deal with)."", ""According to Robert Matthews of Science Focus, toy balloons can ascend around six miles high, while weather balloons (which are made of more durable materials) can go three times that distance. This is thanks to the Archimedes Principle (explained here in this Carol Hodanbosi article for NASA). The balloon floats in the first place because its helium is less dense than the air outside. As a balloon climbs higher, the surrounding air pressure drops, and the helium inside expands. When the density of the balloon matches the density of the air, its ascension stops. And when the expanding helium becomes too much for the toy balloon's latex material, it bursts."", ""Please don't feel compelled to test this out, however. Not only do helium balloons mess with wildlife, they have also been known to cause problems for commercial planes. Sorry to burst your bubble.""]",1

But the report, published in the online version of the journal Menopause in April 2014 doesn’t imply that putting off pregnancy will add years to your life. ""If you physically delay having children, that’s not going to help with longevity, Paola Sebastiani, a Boston University biostatistics professor and study co-author, told OZY. A woman with a natural ability to have children later in life suggests that her body – including her reproductive system – just happens to age at a slow pace. Some women’s biological clocks simply tick more slowly than most.', 'Women who had their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 or older, compared with those who had their last child by 29.', 'Sebastiani and her colleagues analyzed data from the Long Life Family Study, a survey of 551 families, many of whose members lived to a ripe old age. They determined the ages at which 462 women had their last child and how long they ended up living. Turns out women who gave birth to their last child after 33 were twice as likely to live to 95 years or older, compared with those who had their last child by age 29.', 'The researchers suspect that the former group’s DNA might harbor genetic variants that slow aging and lower the risk for age-related diseases that can hamper fertility (like ovarian cancer or diabetes). Women with such variants could presumably bear children for a longer period of time, boosting their chances of passing these genes down to future generations — meaning we may have women to thank for the evolution of longevity genes. It could also explain why of the people who live to be 100 or older, 85% are women, compared to only 15% of men.', 'Earlier studies have unearthed similar insights. Take the ongoing New England Centenarian Study, which found that women who had children after 40 were a whopping four times more likely to live to 100 than women who had their last child at a younger age.', 'Given the possible link between longevity and a longer fertility window, Sebastiani’s findings also suggest that researchers should further investigate the genetic influences of reproductive fitness, since they might also affect aging rates and vulnerability to age-related diseases. Sebastiani and her team have been working to identify the genetic variants that make some women age slower and plan to publish their results at the end of this year. Understanding the pathways they govern could help scientists develop drugs that produce the same effect.', 'So even if your biological clock is ticking, it might still be a while before its alarm goes off — depending on your genes.']",1

['New study sheds light on THIS fishy behavior'],"['How do fish swim in schools, effortlessly coordinating their every move? The answer appears to be ingrained in their genes.', 'The genetic basis underlying the complex, social behavior of schooling is revealed in two studies published Sept. 12 in the journal Current Biology. The studies suggest that schooling is not a learned behavior, and instead show it relies on several regions of the fish genome.', 'The findings may point to the genetic underpinning of why humans also are social, and tend to gather in groups, some experts said, although others debated this.', 'Stickleback to school', 'Most fish exhibit schooling during some phase of their life cycle, research has shown. Fish evolved to swim in schools to better protect themselves from predators, improve their foraging and swim more efficiently.', 'Unlike shoaling, in which fish merely swim loosely together, schooling requires coordinated body positions and synchronized movement. Fish in schools need to sense their environment with high accuracy, maintain awareness of their position within the school, and respond quickly to changes in both water currents and movement of the group.', 'Exactly how fish pull off this feat has remained elusive.', 'In one of the new studies, researchers led by Catherine Peichel, a human biology researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, studied sticklebacks, small fish about 3 inches (8 centimeters) long that live in both salt and fresh water. [Photos: The Freakiest-Looking Fish]', 'The researchers created a handful of fake fish models, suspended them in the water and whirled them about, to entice the real stickleback to join schools.', 'By crossbreeding one kind of stickleback prone to schooling with another kind of stickleback more reluctant to join a school, the researchers identified two genomic regions in sticklebacks associated with schooling. One of these regions is also associated with development of a highly specialized sensory structure unique to fish, known as the lateral line, which can detect vibrations in the water.', 'The lateral line is made up of cells called neuromasts, which are similar to the hair cells found in the human ear and enable the fish to sense changes in water currents and respond accordingly.', 'In the second study, researchers led by Clifford Tabin of Harvard Medical School in Boston studied the Mexican tetra, a freshwater fish also about 3 inches long that lives in open rivers and lakes, and sometimes in the streams of caves. The cave-dwelling variety is blind, and largely albino.', 'The surface-dwelling tetra swim in schools, but the blind cavefish do not, which suggested to the researchers that vision is important to schooling. But after crossbreeding the two varieties and conducting a genetic analysis, the team determined that as the cavefish evolved, they lost the ability to school, and they lost their vision in separate events.', 'This provided more evidence that schooling behavior is genetic-based and not learned, the researchers said.', 'Both research teams identified only genetic regions, not the exact genes, controlling the schooling behavior.', 'Of fish and men', ""The teams remained split, however, on how these findings may relate to humans. Anna Greenwood, a member of Peichel's team, said the findings could be applicable to complex social human behaviors."", '""Because an evolutionarily shared neural circuit, as well as some of the same neurochemicals and hormones, control social behavior in all vertebrates, what we learn about genetic changes in fish could ultimately provide insight into human behavioral variation,"" Greenwood told LiveScience.', 'Hans Hofmann, a professor of integrative biology at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in either study, said the stickleback work rebuts the assertion that human behavior is too complex to understand.', '""I think it shows that even such complex behaviors associated with other individuals in a very rigid and organized manner can be dissected genetically,"" Hofmann said. ""Studies like this tell us that we might get there eventually.""', 'Tabin, however, said the findings of his Mexican cavefish study ""do not tell us anything at all about human social behavior.""', ""But he also said that both studies can tell researchers much about the evolution of schooling behaviors in fish, and that's what makes it worthwhile."", 'Copyright 2013 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

"['Man Pours Milk Into A Bottle Of Coke, Shows Startling Results Minutes Later']","['Coca-Cola and milk are two seemingly innocuous substances that most of us probably have in our kitchens. When combined, however, they produce something unexpected and potentially stomach-churning.', 'Now consider the health risks of consuming too many soft drinks: In this comprehensive article published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health , these sugary beverages are linked to increases in diabetes, heart disease, and other obesity-related ailments in individuals who regularly indulge. The studies and statistics are chilling in an abstract way, but the video below provides a much more concrete demonstration that allows us to visualize the potential damage soft drinks may be doing to our bodies. The premise for this experiment is simple enough to be replicated in a science fair or even a for high school science project, especially since it only requires two ingredients (both of which are readily available). As you may have guessed, the ""scientist"" in the video simply pours milk into a bottle of Coca-Cola, then waits. After only 15 minutes, the solution begins to visibly change. An hour later, the Coca-Cola and milk form a transparent liquid with what can only be described as chunks of sediment settled on the bottom.', 'A blog post on Steve Spangler Science (a website dedicated to making science experiments more accessible and the man responsible for the 2005 "" Diet Coke and Mentos "" viral video) and the YouTube video description for this experiment attribute this ""invisible soda"" phenomenon to Coca-Cola\'s high phosphoric acid content. The soda and milk react to each other in this way because the phosphoric acid molecules in Coke adhere themselves to the milk, which in turn creates a dense solid. That solid separates from the liquid and sinks to the bottom of the container. The coagulate is essentially curdled milk, and looks about as appetizing as it sounds.', ""While this experiment is a cool way to visually demonstrate a chemical reaction in progress, it also reveals a harrowing health hazard in a tangible way. According to WebMD , there has been an observed connection between high soda intake and increased risk of bone fractures, but it wasn't until recently that theories about why this might happen have surfaced. The article mentions that the increased occurrence of osteoporosis in frequent soda drinkers was previously attributed to those people consuming soft drinks instead of calcium-rich beverages like milk or orange juice."", 'However, recent studies have shown that the phosphoric acid in colas may reduce bone density due to the chemical reaction demonstrated below. Katherine Tucker , associate professor of nutritional epidemiology at Tufts University, published a study examining the relationship between regular soft drink consumption and bone health in adults. Tucker found that the differences between her subjects\' bone densities, after eliminating other variables, ""was not due to lower calcium, it was not due to the caffeine in the cola, it was not due to the sugar, and we adjusted for calcium and vitamin D as well as body size. It seems the thing that\'s left is the phosphoric acid."" There is still more research to be done, of course, to find an unequivocal answer. In the meantime, to counteract potential bone loss, it\'s important to increase calcium intake in your diet.']",1

"[""Revenue Ran Away: Pokémon GO's Lost Billions""]","['Pokémon GO has entered Phase 2. Phase 1 was something somewhat surreal, with people roaming in packs in every major city, enriching developer Niantic Labs and the Pokémon Company by untold millions in the process. That was bound to end. The game ended its record breaking stint at the top of the app store\'s ""top grossing"" chart, yielding to more reliable stalwarts like Clash Royale, Mobile Strike and Game of War: Fire Age. It\'s a shame, if only because those first two weeks or so with Pokémon GO were some of the most exciting video game experiences I\'ve had -- pretty much ever. And it\'s a shame because the game stood to make billions more if it had been able to capitalize on that.', 'I don\'t use the word ""billions"" lightly. While real figures for the revenue of any mobile game are notoriously hard to come by, some estimates peg Pokémon GO\'s revenue up at $500 million in just 60 days, putting it on track for $1 billion by the end of the year. And that\'s for the totally bizarre state that it launched in, without even standard, simple revenue streams like cosmetic items, one where you can\'t even buy premium items with real money. That\'s what the developer has repeatedly referred to as a""bare-bones"" state. Even with that, Pokémon GO earned money at a scale that the mobile world has never seen before, sparking a genuine international craze in the process. That fever pitch has now decayed into a standard blockbuster hit, but what if that craze had kept going for just one more month? Two? Not only could it have kept up those numbers for a little while longer, it could have sustained a much smoother drop over the long run. It\'s a big table with a lot of money left on it.', 'It makes me think of Fallout Shelter, another breakout mobile hit on a much smaller scale. Fallout Shelter, like Pokémon GO, came out of the gates with a huge amount of momentum based on the strength of its brand. It made a bunch of money in a few days, and developer Bethesda considers it a smashing success. But like Pokémon GO, it launched without a lot of key features, and players found themselves spinning their wheels after a week or two of play. It started to drop down the charts.', ""More than a year later, Fallout Shelter is an infinitely better game. It has more content, more activities, and more ways to keep players occupied after their initial burst of playtime. The people that stuck around are having fun, but most have moved on. It makes you think: had Bethesda released that game with the fanfare it gave the initial launch, it stood to make not just twice as much money but five, 10 times as much. Maybe more. The thing is, once you integrate the sorts of activities that can really hook people into your gameplay loop, weeks of play can start to turn into months and even years. And that's why a game like this needs them at the beginning, when there are the most people around to be hooked."", ""I foresee something similar happening with Pokémon GO. This game is only going to get better, and Pokémon GO has a long life -- and a hell of a lot of revenue -- left in it. Those that stick around will get gradual improvements, and people who come back up for new waves of Pokémon will find themselves with a better, more addictive experience than they had before. We already have a buddy system, we'll hopefully get nearby tracking back soon and someday we might even get multiplayer battles or, who knows? Maybe a single-player progression. We could, ideally, end up with a Pokémon GO that has an actual endgame -- something to do with all those Pokemon you catch. Some more fleshed out monetization wouldn't hurt, either."", ""It's going to work out well for Niantic, to be sure. But that initial craze is not going to happen again. And so we imagine this improved version of Pokémon GO and we wonder what would have happened had the developer released that game on day one. Would we still have seen the same player drop off? Would we have seen more money out of the players the game did have? It is, of course, impossible to say. But I think about my own experience, and the experience of everyone I know that's played the game. Most people I know played for two weeks. The most enthusiastic lasted a month or so. They could have been convinced to stick around, and they could have been convinced to spend much more money. It's true, Pokémon GO has had better user retention than a lot of other popular apps, but the rules are just different here. On a an intuitive level, it's not hard to imagine how it could have kept going for longer."", 'Most mobile games are total crapshoots, and that\'s why it\'s common practice to release them in a ""bare-bones"" state and improve them based on player feedback -- in the likelihood that they bomb, you want to minimize your losses by not doing too much development up front. Games like Pokémon GO are not like this. It was bound to be a hit, even if nobody could have predicted it would have been a hit on this scale. If you go into that with that knowledge, it makes sense to work as hard as possible to capitalize on that launch momentum.', ""We'll see what happens when releases Super Mario Run. Nintendo isn't given to half-releases, and the success of Super Mario Run is as written in stone as Pokémon GO's was. We're entering into a new era of mobile gaming, and we'll see if the next game to ascend to the heights of Pokémon GO can stay there a little longer.""]",1

He describes exploits in major elections in Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico.', 'In his most noteworthy alleged victory, he claims to have assisted the increasingly unpopular Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto win his 2012 election. Sepúlveda claims that he was given a budget of $600,000 to rig the election in favor of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) candidate. He says he installed malware in his opponents’ routers, which let him tap their phones and computers; sent prerecorded messages to tens of thousands of people in a critical swing state at 3 a.m. on election night, purporting to support another candidate to anger voters; and set up fake Facebook accounts of gay men who purported to support a conservative Catholic candidate, angering many. Bloomberg says that it has verified some of what Sepúlveda claims to have done, but there is no way of verifying it all.', 'Finally, what most caught my eye, and what I think has the most relevance in our broader society, Sepúlveda claims to have maintained an ""army"" of over 30,000 fake Twitter profiles to ""shape discussion"" around certain topics in favor of his candidate, ""priming the social media pump with views that real users would mimic.""', 'This was, according to the report, the tactic that likely had the most impact. It’s a technique that academics call ""cognitive hacking""—in which an attacker attempts to change people’s perception of reality.

Sepúlveda is currently serving 10 years in Colombian prison ""for charges including use of malicious software, conspiracy to commit crime, violation of personal data, and espionage, related to hacking during Colombia’s 2014 presidential election,"" writes Bloomberg.', 'Maintaining Twitter bots may not have been his major crime in the eyes of the law, but the impact that trend bots could have is enormous. Our generation has told ourselves that the value and beauty of social media is that it offers authentic, real-time perspectives from real people. It’s a way to get unfiltered news, rather than being spun by political pundits on cable television.', 'But that perception means we’re vulnerable to the dubious use of such technologies. And people in power have figured that out. In 2014, there was the ""Cuban Twitter"" scandal, in which USAID, an international development arm of the federal government, quietly created an app that allowed Cubans to message each other. Through the use of casual surveys in the app, its creators hoped to identify which users were pro-U.S., seemingly in hopes of giving them an outsized influence over their peers.', '""When I realized that people believe what the Internet says more than reality, I discovered that I had the power to make people believe almost anything."" - Andrés Sepúlveda, Colombian hacker', 'The app ultimately failed, having got too big, too fast, and it became clear that the creators were unable to explain to Cuban authorities how it was paying for itself.', 'A more successful example of cognitive hacking was the Joseph Kony video that went insanely viral in 2012, which introduced the world to a Ugandan war criminal and inspired the U.S. Senate to write a resolution condemning him.

Coakley lost the race.', 'In the latest Pew Research Center survey, 14% of all people polled said they primarily get news about the 2016 presidential election from social media, a tie with local television. Cable television leads the pack, with 24% of all surveyed. But among 18- to 29-year-olds, social media is the top source, with 35% of them saying it’s their primary news source. That makes young people much more susceptible to this kind of manipulation.', 'Not surprisingly, there’s a prime contemporary example for why we should be more questioning of the ""data"" and the ""trends"" that we are currently seeing ripple through the political sphere.', 'For news organizations, one of the biting facts of covering this election cycle has been that the words ""Donald Trump"" attract readers and watchers, thus generating advertising revenue, and incentivizing those same outlets to give him more exposure.', 'It has been mystifying, yet patently real.

Yet traffic to pieces about him and searches for his name have been hitting the ceiling since very early on.', 'This quote from Quartz, from January, explains it:', '""We first noticed how Trump stories drove traffic—and thus revenue—at TheStreet.com last summer, when the name ""Trump"" suddenly spiked in Google searches. Traffic to stories about Trump, even if they contained no substantive new information or a comment from the candidate himself, was running some 10 times higher than that of any other candidate. ""Trump interest has since continued to dominate the web. A simple glance at Google Trends shows Trump searches far outpace those for any other candidate, Democrat or Republican (a phenomenon clearly at play during the Jan 28. debate).""', 'When media get a lot of traffic to a certain kind of story, it’s a sign that their audience is interested and they tend to write more about it.

There’s such a thing as a hate search, and a hate read, and I don’t doubt for a second that many people who hate Trump are reading about him just to keep up-to-date and informed on their hatred. But can that account for all the hype?', 'In yet another troubling quote from the Bloomberg piece, the authors ask Sepúlveda a blunt question: do you think the U.S. election is being tampered with?

Two pairs of sharp cutting edges, the fascicle, break the skin and then search for a blood vessel, withdrawing and re-entering until a suitable target is found. When the blood starts to flow, a salivary tube delivers a protein that stops it clotting. The mosquito holds still and then begins to suck; in 90 seconds’ time, she feels full, and stops. And then, if you are in parts of South and Central America and bang out of luck, you will have Zika.', 'It’s a horrible idea, and one that will draw shudders from anyone who has ever been bitten by a mosquito – which is to say, just about everyone. In the entire animal kingdom, the mosquito occupies a special place as receptacle for our hatred and disgust. Even the great and generous EO Wilson, author of the touchstone argument for preserving biodiversity, The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth, makes an exception for anopheles gambiae, which spreads malaria in Africa. ""Keep their DNA for future research,"" he writes, ""and let them go.""', 'When Wilson thus hardens his heart, he speaks for us all. Where we revere and anthropomorphise such brutal predators as sharks, tigers and bears, we view these tiny ectoparasites as worthless, an evolutionary accident with no redeeming or adorable characteristics. No one ever had a cuddly mosquito. Thanks to malaria, they have probably helped to kill more than half of all humans ever to have lived. Today, according to the Gates foundation, the diseases they carry kill about 725,000 people a year, 600,000 of them victims of malaria. They are, as such, the only creature responsible for the deaths of more humans than humans themselves; we only manage to kill about 475,000 a year. This deadly work is carried out all over the planet: mosquitoes are found on every continent except Antarctica. And now there is Zika, which can lead to microcephaly and its associated physical deformities in unborn children, and for which there is no vaccine. This new horror has prompted fresh attention to the vexed question of how to defeat them. And that consideration leads to an unsentimental thought that we would entertain about no other creature: can’t we wipe them off the face of the Earth?', 'Click here for a video explaining the Zika outbreak.', '""I don’t think most people would have any qualms about totally eliminating them,"" says Professor Hilary Ranson, head of vector biology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. ""I spend most of my time trying to keep them alive and study them, but that’s in order to try to kill them. Ultimately I wouldn’t be too sentimental."" Professor Steve Lindsay, a public-health entomologist at the University of Durham agrees: ""I have no problem with taking out the mosquito.""', 'In reality, as Lindsay and Ranson are quick to point out, the total extinction of all mosquito species would be as senseless as it would be impossible. Of the 3,000 varieties on the planet, only 200 or so bite us; only Aedes aegypti, and perhaps the more common Culex quinquefasciatus, are thought to carry Zika. Besides, as Jules Pretty, professor of environment and society at the University of Essex, points out: ""In lots of environments, especially the Arctic north, where their abundance is utterly dispiriting, they are a vital source of food for animals higher up the food chain."" A total mosquito apocalypse would be a catastrophe.', 'There are extinction options. It wouldn’t be easy, but we shouldn’t forget about it Jo Lines', 'But what about a narrower specicide, wiping out Aedes aegypti, and dealing a devastating blow to Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya alike? Well, that might be much more desirable – and much more achievable. ""We’ve got really good new weapons,"" says Dr Jo Lines, reader of malaria control and vector biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""There are extinction options. It wouldn’t be easy, but we shouldn’t forget about it.""', 'For Lines, there is a more pressing case for the eradication of aegypti, as a carrier of dengue fever, than any other species of mosquito. ""There is no visible end to this except a war against aegypti,"" he says. ""Otherwise this is going to go on for a thousand years."" He points out that because aegypti are thoroughly adapted to a man-made environment, unlike the anopheles variety that carry malaria, they will only become more prevalent as the human population and its accompanying urban sprawl grow. ""The other things we’ll build out. West Nile, malaria ... but this is not going to fade away. These things are like rats and pigeons. We give them their home and food.""', 'So how, exactly, would we go about it? For the specicide advocates, the most promising means of attack lies in a cutting-edge technology known as a gene drive, the subject of much excited reporting in recent weeks. And no wonder, so seductively dystopian is its premise: that a species can be eradicated by altering the genetic code of males in captivity so that they will only be able to produce sterile offspring, then releasing them into the wild to mate with unsuspecting females, rendering the next generation barren. Oxitec, a British company that has pioneered this kind of genetic modification, has been conducting trials since 2009, and has a production facility in Campinas, Brazil. And it is not alone.', '""It really has been a gamechanger,"" says Andrea Crisanti, professor of molecular parasitology at Imperial College London. ""We are able to modify the gene with unprecedented precision and flexibility."" Crisanti, a leading expert in the field, has focused his own work on a similar mechanism that fights the malaria-carrying Anopheles gambiae, but he says that it could be exported to other species as well. ""There are lots of advantages. If it doesn’t work, nobody has to worry: if they can’t breed, the GM is selected out. If it works, in theory you have total extinction. And if people are concerned about that, you can keep some in the laboratory and reintroduce them. So it is totally reversible."" He gives a small laugh, and sounds freshly amazed at the power of the technology at his fingertips. ""We can edit nature,"" he says. ""This is an incredible new development.""', 'There are practical impediments to this plan at the moment, though. ""The number of sterile males you’d have to release is just phenomenal,"" says Ranson. All the same, the approach could make huge inroads in controlling the population, and extinction may be a realistic goal. Crisanti acknowledges the risks that his work brings with it. ""But on the battlefield of risk-management, you have to accept that any measure has a risk to be balanced against the benefit. There is a risk we all rush, and that shouldn’t be done. We shouldn’t implement this on an emotional basis just because we don’t have anything else. And we shouldn’t take shortcuts in the regulatory process. We don’t want it to backfire when it could be a gamechanger for public health.""', 'If people are concerned, you can keep some in the lab and reintroduce them. It is totally reversible. We can edit nature Andrea Crisanti', 'Still, talk of ""editing nature"" will unnerve those who are naturally suspicious of such radical moves, and for whom the term ""genetic modification"" is an automatic red flag. Some fear that the precise effects on the mosquitoes’ ecosystems are still hazy (while they might be our nemeses, there are fish that think they’re delicious). But most biologists are confident that such fears are misplaced. ""Ecosystems would adapt,"" says Ranson. ""There are so many similar mosquito species that don’t transmit disease that something else would fulfil that niche without doing any major harm.""', 'Lines agrees: ""Everywhere they exist, apart from parts of east Africa, they are an invasive species. So getting rid of them would be a boon to the ecosystem. What are the local things that eat aegypti that might say, ‘Now we’re hungry’? Well, there are fish and insects that eat the larvae and bats that eat the adults, and birds and geckos, but all of those predators have got other things to eat.""', 'For others, the attention-grabbing qualities of a genetically modified mosquito spreading its poisoned seed are a source of more frustration than wonder; a distraction from on-the-ground efforts that could make a substantial difference in the fight against Zika and dengue fever right away. ""What it mainly is is irritating,"" says Lindsay. ""Everyone talks about vaccines and GM, but actually we can control this vector by much simpler means."" Lindsay points out that aegypti were eliminated from much of South America in the 1960s by the simple mechanism of spraying containers with oil, kerosene and, later, the controversial pesticide DDT. Today, with a much larger human population and some pesticide resistance, that process is much more difficult; above all, the growth in the population of aegypti is down to our rapid increase in plastic consumption; it provides the mosquitos with an ideal breeding ground.', '""There is so much misinformation out there,"" Lindsay says. ""You see pictures of large open areas of stagnant water. But that’s not where the danger is. This thing breeds in small containers: flowerpots, gutters, tyres, water bottles. It’s about screening buildings, putting up nets, spraying insecticide in laundry areas. That’s not something for health professionals: that’s about educating and empowering communities so that they can reduce the risk themselves."" So vexed is Lindsay by the way this crucial message is, in his view, being drowned out, that he and a group of colleagues have written a letter to the Lancet, shortly to be published, urging a renewed focus on these less exotic measures. ""We have tools available,"" it reads, ""that we can use to defeat this mosquito vector today.""', 'Professor Trudie Lang, a senior research fellow at Oxford and head of the Global Health Network, tells a similar story. Her research is focused on improving public health, and connecting researchers and health workers in developing countries. It is, again, an unglamorous specialism – but a critical one, for the fight against Zika as much as anything else.', '""There’s this incredible study on foetal scans and baby measurements,"" Lang explains, ""which will mean that at least people can interpret the scans properly; if the problem is with foetal development then we have to know how that occurs. But these kinds of big studies are really underfunded, and because this kind of research doesn’t get any attention, that’s why we are where we are with Zika. The really hi-tech, GM stuff – bring it on. Marvellous. It gets people excited, it gets the [research] papers in Nature. But the normal, everyday stuff – the pragmatic, frontline research – can make some of the biggest differences. And it’s very, very difficult to get funding to support research-capacity development."" Read the deadly last three words of that quote and you will see exactly where the problem lies. ""The trouble,"" Lang says with a sigh, ""is that it just isn’t sexy.""', 'An Aedes aegypti mosquit, photographed in a lab at the University of El Salvador.', 'It is hard to prove a direct causal link between the exoticised enthusiasm for wiping out a species on the one hand and the underfunding of such crucial work on the other. All the same, there is a certain bitter irony that in an attempt to beat a disease whose impact will be felt most keenly by women and their unborn children, and which has been exacerbated by a shortage of funding for studies that would focus on the wellbeing of women in developing countries, we are contemplating a macho solution that entails sending male mosquitoes to impregnate as many females as possible, with the ultimate ambition of wiping the enemy off the face of the Earth.', 'Whatever the priorities, no scientist disputes that if the technology were to be perfected, the gene-drive plan would be a remarkable boon to public health. Yet there may be other, more abstract, objections contained in the eerie idea of that word: extinction, the permanent eradication of a species that has evolved and survived for thousands of years. Melanie Challenger, author of On Extinction: How We Became Estranged from Nature, travelled from England to South America to the Antarctic to think about how we contend with the elimination of the species. ""Is there a more intrinsic philosophical reason why we shouldn’t drive an animal to extinction?"" she asks. ""My instinct is: yes. If a part of our brain lights up with caution, that’s a really good instinct, and we should heed it. I don’t think ‘love of nature’ is a good reason not to do it. But I do think there’s something more robust: the sanctity of life. If you start getting cavalier about the existence of a living being, if we start to think it’s OK to eradicate something because it’s a threat to us, we put other ideas about the sanctity of life in question. And because that’s ultimately an artificial, human concept, it needs to be cherished.""', 'Yet even Challenger acknowledges that such arguments might seem a bit abstract to the mother of a child who will be deformed because of Zika, or killed by malaria. ""I’m a mum,"" she says, ""and no one can understand more than a mother the heartache and importance and power of keeping your children alive."" Crisanti has a ready riposte to such abstract concerns: if we had already wiped out aegypti, would we ever contemplate reintroducing them? ""When you reverse the argument,"" he says, ""I think it’s clear.""', 'In the end, if the technical and ecological objections can be overcome, it seems unlikely that philosophical arguments for the sanctity of aedes aegypti will hold sway. The mosquito has so ravaged us, for so long, that for most people it has exhausted all rights of appeal. Pretty, whose work straddles the arts and sciences, has also written about extinction. In his book, The Edge of Extinction, he considers how different cultures deal with the loss of species and habitats that surround them. It is fair to say that he is an advocate of conservation. But even he has his limit. ""If one has a hierarchy of thoughts,"" he says, ""the first would be that it would be desirable if we humans had a lighter impact and that any loss is one that should be deeply worrying. And in most cases you can stop at that point. But here you can ask the second question: if there was a loss of a whole species, would there be a human benefit? And in this case, the human benefit is so great that I think you have to say: ‘OK, I can hold these two thoughts at once.’""']",1

Things get out of hand quickly, but it’s the perfectly invoked sense of the era that keeps Hot Summer Nights from falling into clichéd territory.', 'For audiences who grew up during the early 1990s, the appeal of this summertime coming-of-ager is spelled out in its well-executed swaths of pop-cultural nostalgia.

""We didn’t want it to feel like people were playing dress-up, or that it was just kind of a pastiche or a ‘wink wink.’"" He also wanted to avoid direct parallels between his movie — for which the director is seeking distribution — and other highly successful projects that have benefited from nostalgia.

Now it’s very dangerous, because they’ve done such a good job capturing that, and you have to be careful not to get too close to that because you’ll be compared to them.""', 'Bynum’s brand of authenticity could come from the fact that he based the narrative on a true story, of two guys he went to college with.

""These small towns have legends and folklore, and they’re passed down through generations,"" the Amherst, Massachusetts, native said.

Unfortunately, the ""sell in May"" approach has gotten mixed results in recent years and may no longer be a viable strategy. But regardless of the performance of the overall market over the next six months, there are still plenty of stocks that investors should consider selling this May. Here are seven stocks to sell in May or any other month of the year, according to Bank of America analysts.', 'Accenture (ticker: ACN)', 'Accenture is a global information technology services company that derives less than half its revenue from North America. When Accenture cut its fiscal 2020 guidance in late March, analyst Jason Kupferberg said he did not think the updated guidance was conservative. The updated guidance calls for revenue growth to bottom in the fiscal third quarter at between negative 2% and positive 2%, less than half the peak-to-trough deceleration the company experienced during the financial crisis. Kupferberg says project-based business visibility is currently extremely limited. Bank of America has an ""underperform"" rating and $154 price target for ACN stock.', 'Caterpillar (CAT)', 'It makes sense for investors to consider buying the dip in Caterpillar, the world\'s largest construction equipment maker. The company has a strong balance sheet and pays an appealing 3.8% dividend. However, analyst Ross Gilardi says it is extremely unlikely for Caterpillar shares to outperform while dealer sales are dropping, and he anticipates further dealer deterioration in the second quarter. Caterpillar earnings per share were down 45% in the first quarter, and Gilardi says the worst is yet to come in the second quarter. Bank of America has an ""underperform"" rating and $115 price target for CAT stock.', 'U.S. Bancorp (USB)', 'U.S. Bancorp is the fifth-largest U.S. bank, and in its recent earnings report, management was adamant that the company has a strong enough balance sheet to maintain its 4.9% dividend and absorb future credit losses even in a severe economic downturn. Analyst Erika Najarian says U.S. Bancorp is a quality company, but its premium valuation relative to its banking peers doesn\'t fully reflect the risk to the company\'s pre-provision net revenue. Bank of America has an ""underperform"" rating and $35 price target for USB stock.', 'Illinois Tool Works (ITW)', 'Illinois Tool Works produces fasteners, consumables and other specialty industrial products. Gilardi says the stock is relatively defensive and the company is highly diversified. Unfortunately, the company\'s restaurant business has been pummeled by social distancing shutdowns. Gilardi says the food equipment market could decline by 30% in 2020. While grocery, hospital, school and military demand should remain relatively stable, Gilardi says Illinois Tool\'s overall demand will likely drop sharply in 2020. He says the stock\'s performance could lag given the challenging environment. Bank of America has an ""underperform"" rating and $130 price target for ITW stock.', 'Biogen (BIIB)', 'Biotech giant Biogen develops and markets treatments for multiple sclerosis, tumors and inflammatory diseases. Analyst Geoff Meacham says Biogen\'s first-quarter earnings report was impressive, including its decision to maintain 2020 guidance. However, he says the company\'s announcement that the biologics license application filing date for Alzheimer\'s disease treatment aducanumab has been delayed from early this year to the third quarter is troubling. Meacham says aducanumab is the biggest future value driver for the stock, and Biogen provided no reason for the delay. The Food and Drug Administration is likely prioritizing the current health crisis for now. Bank of America has an ""underperform"" rating and $245 price target for BIIB stock.', 'Sherwin-Williams (SHW)', 'Sherwin-Williams is the second-largest coatings company in the world, generating more than 75% of its business from North America.

A recent survey of paint contractors suggests a large number of commercial and residential project cancellations through the end of 2020, which is bad news for Sherwin-Williams. Byrne says Valspar and HGTV products could see a demand bump, but the company\'s Americas segment derives only about 15% of revenues from its DIY sales.

Analyst Derik de Bruin says first-quarter sales were better than feared, and Illumina\'s strong balance sheet provides capital deployment opportunities. But lab shutdowns and a potential shift in funding due to the health crisis create uncertainty. Illumina recently abandoned its $1.2 billion buyout of Pacific Biosciences (PACB). In addition, de Bruin says emerging competitors could continue to pressure pricing, and Illumina has risks tied to execution and visibility.

But at this price it’s vulnerable to a wealth of talent, in particular the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC, both of which are on a different level in terms of ability, desirability and quality. The Edge looks the part and is packed with kit, but you need much more than that to challenge in this competitive class.', 'You could be forgiven for thinking the Ford Edge had been around for some time. First shown as a concept back in 2013, it then went on sale in the US two years ago, before finally making the trip across the Atlantic and on to European soil. So it faces a tough fight when it reaches UK showrooms in the middle of the year, thanks to the frantic and competitive nature of the SUV market the Edge is wading into.', ""To give you some context, the Edge sits above the EcoSport and Kuga in Ford's SUV hierarchy, and is aimed at established German rivals such as the BMW X3 and Audi Q5. But don’t think it’ll leave you better off financially just because it’s a Ford"", 'the Edge costs largely the same as the competition it’s squaring up to. Prices start from £29,995 and rise to £36,750 – the sort of cash buyers have been spending on X3s for years.', 'The car we have here sits at the very top of the line-up: a 208bhp 2.0-litre biturbo diesel, fitted with a six-speed automatic gearbox and four-wheel drive. In Sport spec, it’s the most expensive Edge on sale – without options – at £36,750.', 'You do get plenty of kit for your money', 'active noise-cancelling technology, 20-inch alloy wheels, a leather interior, an eight-inch infotainment system with sat-nav and a front view camera all come as standard. If you want your X3 or Q5 to match the Edge for kit, you’ll have to head to the options list.', 'The Edge looks the part, too. It’s nicely proportioned with broad shoulders and chiselled flanks. Sport models also get darkened front and rear bumpers and chrome tailpipes as extra decoration.', 'Inside is less exciting, though. The Edge is based on the same platform as the humble Mondeo, so comes with a selection of the same engines, and an identical interior. It’s not unpleasant, but the design is just a little bland and unimaginative – especially compared to the equivalent opulence the Mercedes GLC will cocoon you in for almost the same amount of cash.', 'And something else the Edge has adopted from its smaller sibling is a rather unremarkable driving experience.', 'The new Mondeo ushered in a more comfort-oriented and relaxed character for big, modern-day Fords. For an SUV – whose primary function is to transport lots of people and things around comfortably – a more relaxed manner sounds like an ideal foundation to work from, but it has its drawbacks.', 'On the move, the Edge absorbs bumps and ruts, but the large 20-inch alloys do sniff out bigger road imperfections. There’s softness in the suspension, despite Sport models coming with firmer springs, which means there’s a noticeable degree of body roll though corners – more so than any of its rivals. This is exaggerated by the disconnected and elastic feel of the steering.', 'Few of the Edge’s rivals are what you’d call engaging to drive, but all go about their business in a more polished way. The engine-gearbox combination is slick, but it does feel a little hesitant working its way through the ratios, which, combined with the hefty kerbweight, can make performance feel blunted.', 'The Edge is over two tonnes with a couple of passengers on board, and you can really feel it', 'acceleration is lethargic even with 208bhp and 450Nm of torque. But what’s likely to matter more to buyers is space and practicality, and here the Edge begins to claw back some honour.', 'With the rear seats in place, the boot measures in at 602 litres, which swells to 1,788 litres if you drop the rear seats. That’s more than any rival from Audi, Mercedes or BMW, but that cavernous load area does appear to have come at the expense of rear passenger space. The back isn’t what you’d called cramped, but given the Edge’s significant size advantage over the Q5 and GLC, there appears to be little benefit for those sitting in the back. Legroom is generous enough, but you’d be just as comfortable in the back of an Audi.', ""A bigger issue was the optional panoramic roof fitted to our test car, which noticeably impinged on headroom. As bright and airy as it makes the cabin, it’s probably not worth the sacrifice you have to make in terms of practicality. '""]",1

Cockroaches hate the smell of bay leaves, making them an excellent all-natural repellant! Just place bay leaves around all the corners of your house, particularly in areas with food, such as your kitchen. It’s also a good idea to put them in your garden!

For Sandler, the most prominent examples of that wasted money are Jack & Jill and That’s My Boy. ""We estimate that for every dollar Sandler was paid on his last three movies, the films returned an average of $3.40,"" Forbes‘ Dorothy Pomerantz writes.', 'Here’s who rounded out the rest of the top 10:', 'Katherine Heigl', 'Reese Witherspoon', 'Nicholas Cage', 'Kevin James', 'Denzel Washington', 'Steve Carell', 'Jennifer Aniston', 'Matt Damon', 'Ryan Reynolds', 'Of all the lists that Forbes releases, this is perhaps the one that is hardest to draw on for a big-picture meditation about Hollywood. The list only accounts for pay, expenses and profits, so actors who may boost prestige (Matt Damon, for example) may be worth something intangible that’s not factored into the equation. The list contains a mix of genders and a mix of comedy- and action-stars; and it’s also a ratio of pay-to-return, which means not-quite-as-expensive stars can make the list. So, unlike the publication’s lists of top-earning stars or a list of top-earning movies, it doesn’t necessarily mean that, say, women are underpaid or that studios depend too much on action. The only big take-away, then, is a basic of most economic markets: past performance does not guarantee future results.', 'And in the end Adam Sandler himself provides a great example of that truth. The Forbes list looks at three years worth of work, but their master ranking of earnings is put together over the summer, which means that the three-year period ended June 1, 2013.

There appears to be a series of calderas at the summit, similar in shape to the elongated and merged craters atop Mauna Loa, Sager said.', 'Until now, geologists thought Tamu Massif was simply part of an oceanic plateau called Shatsky Rise in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Oceanic plateaus are massive piles of lava whose origins are still a matter of active scientific debate. Some researchers think plumes of magma from deep in the mantle punch through the crust, flooding the surface with lava. Others suggest pre-existing weaknesses in the crust, such as tectonic-plate boundaries, provide passageways for magma from the mantle, the layer beneath the crust.

But a church of the second century would understand that this is a homosexual relationship and it wasn\'t a big deal.', ""So what evidence is there in the bible of Jesus's homosexuality?"", 'There\'s hints of it, and then there\'s readings into it. The hints come from John\'s Gospel with the ""beloved disciple."" He and Jesus have an intimate relationship, although there are questions as to who the disciple actually is. Anyhow, the beloved disciple is lying on the chest of Jesus at the last supper and is supposedly in his ""inner tunic,"" which is what we would call underwear today. It\'s a very intimate gesture, and it\'s a special gesture of affection between the two.', 'I would imagine Jesus loved all of his disciples, I mean he told everyone to love their neighbor. So, singling out a particular person as ""beloved"" seems significant.', 'Yes. Jesus only calls one other person beloved and it is Lazarus. There was also an excerpt that was discovered in the 1960s by a professor of history and ancient studies, Morton Smith, a very good scholar. He found an inscription that hints at a secret gospel, that people are dating back to sometime in the late part of the first century. There is a fragment that describes a naked boy who comes to Jesus very late, and spends the night for an ""initiation."" The fragment has been disputed, of course. But what this has to say is that there was some sort of homoerotic relationship, a love relationship.', ""It seems that, like anything else in the Bible, you can draw your own conclusions, including that Jesus was gay. I mean, he's this queer figure, never married"", 'That is actually significant. Jesus was a rabbi, a teacher, and pretty much every rabbi at the time was married. But there\'s no testimony of Jesus\'s marriage. There are some interesting theories, Jesus could have been bisexual and carried on a relationship with Mary Magdalene and the beloved disciple. Perhaps he was intersex or trans, because he was born without a father, and therefore was born female and took on the phenotype of a male. Virginia Mollenkott argues that in her book, Omnigender. It\'s a fun sort of argument. What I\'m saying is that people see this as really important. I once had a lesbian student tell me, ""Jesus wasn\'t gay, he was perfect."" So what does that say about how she views her sexuality? The Catholic position says that Jesus is perfect, so therefore he is intrinsically good and intrinsically ordered. Now what they say about gays is we are intrinsically evil and intrinsically disordered. Even evangelicals will say that Jesus was perfect so that, in order to be saved for evangelicals, you must be heterosexual to be saved.', ""But if Jesus was gay, and he was perfect, then really it's only the gay people that are going to heaven, right? That's so deliciously ironic."", 'You know, I think there\'s a greater picture about how universal Jesus is. Jesus had sexuality. I used to think that everything about Jesus was perfect. Then in my first year of school, I was reading a book by John A.T. Robinson, an Anglican bishop and New Testament scholar, The Human Face of God, and there was a little footnote there that really disturbed me. It said that Jesus farted. And I said, ""Oh my god!"" And then I thought, Well, OK. He was human. And that led to, ""If he was also human, did he have an erection at night? Did he have a nocturnal emission? All males experience that."" So that was kind of an eroding of my sort of Catholic fundamentals around Jesus. And I went the next step by saying, ""Was Jesus sexual?"" And then, ""With whom?"" Then I thought, ""Does it really matter?"" And I think it does.', ""If Jesus was fully human, he must have been fully erotic. That would mean that sexuality was a positive thing, because we need to reclaim the fact that sexuality is a great and good thing, whatever sexuality that you are. So, you see where I'm coming from? I want to say that all sexualities are an original blessing because we're made in the image of God."", ""What I'm getting from this the most is that Jesus, as a queer human individual, could at least relate to the struggle of gay men—feeling like outcasts, having violence perpetrated on them for their queerness, whatever it may be."", ""Yeah, I'd say that you're absolutely on solid ground with your statement."", ""Even if Jesus wasn't gay, I imagine he'd certainly feel more kinship with the minority of homosexuals than the heteronormative Christians who preach hate."", ""It's funny, because fundamentalists go back and misread these things and get hysterical about it because they do not understand the historical context. They misuse it and they misrepresent their own ideology. And often times they're vehement about it because they have so much internalized homophobia, which indicates to me that they have those same attractions to the same sex that they need to stamp them out in other people. Jesus was not a fundamentalist. He's not a literalist. He spoke in parables and metaphor and story.""]",1

Beer in cans, bottles or barrels contains a lot of dissolved CO2 under pressure, he says, and when improperly handled it can cause bubbles and foam to overflow or improperly foam.', 'So, if the bubbles are too big — a common result of a hand-pour — our mouths perceive a ""grainy"" feel, which can lead many a beer drinker to avoid pouring heads altogether. But that’s a mistake, according to Petracca. Not only does the head insulate the rest of the beer from flavor-robbing oxygen (even a few minutes of air exposure can degrade the taste), but it can also help seal in the gases that give beer its effervescence, something that likewise maximizes flavor.', '... produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft.', 'The Fizzics machine, which is about the size of a small kitchen appliance, produces a head with small, perfectly formed bubbles, which delivers a creamy mouthfeel — like a draft. Here’s how it works. Place a bottle, can or growler (a reusable container for transporting draft beer) — the Fizzics machine doesn’t care — inside its sealed chamber. Pull forward on the silver tap handle to pressurize the chamber, which forces the beer out of its original container and into your glass via a small plastic tube. The magic happens toward the end of the pour, when you push the tap handle backward. This action kick-starts the patented agitation process, which turns the remaining drops of liquid into an ultra-smooth head, using sound waves. There are no gas cylinders or other consumables needed — just four AA batteries.', 'Steve Abrams, co-founder of Canada’s Mill Street Brewery, agrees a good beer head improves the taste of a brew considerably, noting that in Europe, bartenders will often take extra time to ""layer"" your beer as it’s poured. Though he hasn’t tried the Fizzics, Abrams has encountered ""lots of beer gadgets,"" even one that lets you pour a beer with your mind. He says the Fizzics could indeed improve a beer’s taste, as long as it’s served cold. But some might find the selling price of $150 (they start shipping in October) a bit steep. Petracca defends the cost, pointing out that when compared to a night at a bar, ""it’s not expensive at all, if experiences and social connections are important.""', 'Perhaps it’s a nice idea for a gift, but Abrams points out that ""pouring beer into a glass is not rocket science,"" and offers up this video for those who need a quick 101 on the technique. Rocket science or not, the Fizzics would certainly make a good conversation piece. To that, we say, ""Cheers!""']",1
"['5 car brands to buy, 5 to avoid']","['Some people buy cars and only need them to perform specific tasks, but for a lot of people, cars need to be good all-around vehicles. We can nitpick its opinions on specific models, but it’s hard to argue that Consumer Reports doesn’t provide the best information on how well-rounded cars are. Since it buys the cars it tests outright, its opinions are about as unbiased as car reviews come. For most shoppers, that kind of information is an important part of the car-buying process.', 'Each year, Consumer Reports compiles the road test scores and reliability ratings from each car in a brand’s lineup and gives that brand an overall score. It then ranks automakers to see which brands do the best and which do the worst. Some brands do exceptionally well in road tests but fall flat on reliability, but often, reliable cars perform poorly in road tests.', 'Which brands got the balance right, and which ones need some improvement? Here are the five best- and five worst-rated car brands in the U.S., according to Consumer Reports.', 'Best', '5. Subaru', 'Subaru has a great reputation in the outdoor adventure community, and its vehicles are popular choices in areas with harsh winters, but all-wheel-drive isn’t the only thing Subaru is known for. Its predicted reliability score was very good, while its average road test score was a strong 80, giving it a 73 overall.', '4. Audi', 'Like Subaru, Audi is also known for its all-wheel-drive technology. In recent years, it’s also received praise for its attractive designs and high-quality interiors. Its reliability has come up drastically in recent years, as well. When paired with a score of 81 on the road test, Audi just barely edges out Subaru with a score of 73 as well.', '3. Toyota', 'Toyota is known for reliability, but its cars have also been getting better to drive. That makes it a popular choice with both buyers and Consumer Reports. Its road test score is only a 72, but its well above-average reliability leads it to an overall score of 74.', '2. Mazda', 'Mazda might not be the most popular brand in the U.S., but anyone who is shopping for a car and doesn’t at least test drive a Mazda is missing out. Car enthusiasts love Mazdas, regular car buyers love Mazdas, and Consumer Reports loves Mazdas, too. It gets a road test score of 76, and with excellent reliability, it receives an overall score of 75.', '1. Lexus', 'Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lexus is at the top of this list. Not only did it receive the highest score for reliability, but its cars performed admirably in the road test, scoring a 76. Lexus has always made reliable cars, but in recent years, it’s focused on making cars that handle and perform better as well. That effort is paying off, giving Lexus a total score of 78.', 'Worst', '5. Ford', 'Following the financial crisis, Ford did an amazing job of reinventing itself. It has launched new vehicles that look better, drive better, use less gasoline, and offer innovative technology. As a result, Ford has a strong road test score of 72. Unfortunately, reliability struggles are what hold Ford back, giving it an overall score of 53.', '4. Dodge', 'Dodge has focused on design and styling lately, and it’s certainly paid off for the brand. Cars like the Challenger and the Charger are about as cool as it gets, and Dodges drive pretty well, too. Consumer Reports gives the brand a respectable road test score of 71. Reliability is where Dodge falls short, though, and that drags its overall score down to a 52.', '3. Mini', 'Minis, especially the two-door hardtop, are practical in the city, quirky, and incredibly fun to drive. Consumer Reports gives the lineup a 72 on the road test, but unfortunately, Mini reliability still scores very low. Owners sure love their Minis, but with reliability low enough to drag its total score down to a 46, owning one can be expensive.', '2. Jeep', 'Jeep is known for prioritizing rugged design and off-road ability over on-road refinement, and it’s a strategy that continues to pay off for the brand. Considering its bias toward making sure its vehicles are capable off-road instead of refined and quiet, it should come as no surprise that Jeep scored only a 59 in the road test. Like the rest of the FCA lineup though, reliability is Jeep’s biggest struggle, and its overall score only comes out to a 39.', '1. Fiat', 'For readers who are familiar with Consumer Reports’ ratings, it should come as no surprise that Fiat is at the bottom of the overall rankings. Despite how fun Fiats are to drive, they tend to be unrefined, and they don’t do well in Consumer Reports’ testing. Reliability is a huge concern, dragging a score of 55 on the road test down to a 32 overall.']",1

['Scientists Explain Why Cats Purr'],"['If you’re lucky enough to get a cat’s attention, let alone his love and tolerance of your snuggles, you might get the chance to hear him purr. Veterinary scientists often ponder the specific message cats are sending when they purr. Is it more than just communicating happiness? Is it basically the feline version of a dog wagging its tail? Is it just a pointless instinctual response? It turns out that the meaning behind a powerful purr is more than just the cat’s equivalent to a human smile. Even more, it’s more complex than you would think.', 'Have you ever caught yourself thinking, ""She’s purring so I guess it’s okay...""', 'I wouldn’t be so sure. A cat’s meow does not always signal happiness; in fact it could also be anxiety or discomfort that the cat is actually experiencing. Scientists believe that the purr could then be a representation of self-healing, a way for the cat to deal with stressful situations involving laser pointers and dangling strings that are just out of reach.', 'Ever try to reproduce a purring sound yourself? It’s hard for humans to mimic, since it involves a very unique and specialized oscillation of the laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles surrounding the feline vocal cords. A cat’s purr is even unique to domestic cats, although bigger cats like cheetahs, pumas, and leopards do have their own version of communication through purring.', 'A cat’s purr falls between a frequency of 25 and 150 Hertz. Guess what! This is also the rate at which muscles and bones are best able to grow and conduct self-repair. Our furry feline friends are on to something genius. Indeed, scientists believe this distinctive frequency is the result of a naturally-selected behavior that led to the evolution of purring kitties.', 'Purring is taught to kittens by their mothers as a lesson in communicating, in the same way that they are taught to meow.', 'There are also scientists who believe that a kitty purr could be an expression of hunger. There might even be a special purr the cat incorporates when he’s craving some kitty chow. This sound is also reminiscent of the murmur of human babies. These frisky felines are tapping into our human maternal and paternal instinctual behaviors!', 'Despite all the signs linking cat purring behavior to certain ulterior motives, some veterinarians just believe that the purr has almost no significant meaning.', '""People will smile when they’re nervous, when they want something, and when they’re happy, so perhaps the purr can also be an appeasing gesture,"" Dr. Kelly Morgan from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign College of Veterinary Medicine told WebMD.', 'Scientists can continue to speculate about the meaning of the feline purr, but unless cats develop the ability to perform human-like speech, it’ll probably always be a mystery.

Speedrunners, however, have figured out how to beat the game in just a little over an hour. It’s incredible.', '[Warning: some of the run has some heated clashes with his roomates.]', 'The run is done on the ‘very easy’ difficulty, with a character speccing for max agility and endurance. As for perks, BubblesDelFuego tags Action Boy earlier on, something which regenerates his Action Points quickly. Together, these attributes create a character who has a lot of stamina to sprint across the Commonwealth, along with enough HP to survive incoming attacks.', 'Sponsored', 'And here’s the route that BubblesDelFuego takes during his run, roughly:', 'At first, there doesn’t seem to be anything unusual about the run. BubblesDelFuego speeds through dialogue, and hauls ass into Vault 111. Innocuous enough! ...and then the glitches start. Completing the game quickly means taking advantage of a number of curious exploits within the game, many of which BubblesDelFuego details here:', 'The first exploit is simple: ‘quick reload.’ Basically, after hotkeying two different weapons, the player can swap between them to reload faster, without having to go through the entire reloading animation. Done quickly enough, the player can essentially shoot endlessly, without ever having to reload.', 'Another glitch described in the video is ‘item climbing,’ something which you see early on in the actual run. The way it works is, you can hold an item, like say a bucket, and angle it in such a way that it lets you walk backwards up a wall, like so:', 'GIF', 'In certain places, doing item climbing also lets the player clip through walls, which is useful for skipping entire sections at a time.', 'Another big glitch used to speedrun Fallout 4 is ‘Power Armor clipping.’ Get this: if you stand in front of a wall in third person while wearing Power Armor, eject from the armor, and then immediately go back into the armor, the game will load you through the wall you were standing in front of—WITH the Power Armor, to boot.', 'The craziest glitch, in my opinion at least, has to be ‘cover slides.’', 'GIF', 'First, you use the cover mechanic to aim behind cover. While popping out behind cover, you can then go into third person. This allows you to then let go of the sights, without actually doing the animation for getting out of cover—this, in turn, lets you run around as you wish. From there, if you then go back into first person, the character will teleport back to where they originally took cover, without actually having to run back there.', 'On its own, it’s not a terribly useful glitch—it’s theoretically useful, sure, but that’s about it at the moment. Where things get really interesting, however, is if you perform the cover part of the glitch indoors, go outside, and then go back into first person outdoors. BubblesDelFuego does so after clearing out Concord and saving the Minutemen, and the glitch flings his character to the center of the ENTIRE overworld map. BubblesDelFuego even pops some Jet in the middle of this glitch, which allows him to throw his character even further than usual. He goes from standing in Concord, to suddenly falling right outside of Greenetech Genetics, without having to actually walk there. It’s astounding.', 'You may be wondering, well, if the player can cross such a great distance without having to play through it, why bother going through Concord and saving the Minutemen at all? Why not just immediately go to the center of the map, which puts you closer to the main quest? Well, the only way to survive the cover slide teleportation is with Power Armor—the glitch drops you from the sky at a great height. Dangerous!', 'After landing at Greenetech Genetics, BubblesDelFuego makes his way to a nearby underwater pipe. This is actually a locale that’s a part of a main quest with the Minutemen. Under normal circumstances, just being in that location doesn’t do anything for the player—you must go through the introductory quests first. However, speedrunners have figured out that if you go to this sewer and use Power Armor clipping, you can force the game to load the final quest for that area. It’s ridiculous and fascinating.', 'Thing is, forcing the game to put you on the final quest doesn’t mean you suddenly just have access to the Institute. That’s why you see BubblesDelFuego going from launching the final quest, to doing some of the earlier main quest missions: he has to build the teleporter that will get him inside the Institute. Once he gets there, however, he can just do the final quest stuff instead of having to sit through the big reveal that normally happens on your first visit to the Institute.', 'Those are the bigger, flashier portions of the speedrun—but the rest of it is pretty fantastic, too. Throughout, you watch BubblesDelFuego running straight past things, including fearsome Deathclaws and the highly toxic Glowing Sea, without much gear or firepower to protect himself. Somehow, though, he manages to survive through it all. My favorite part, however, is watching BubblesDelFuego repeatedly shoot Nick Valentine in the face—doing so actually lets him skip lines of dialogue, thus moving the game faster. A close runner-up moment, though, is seeing how even speedrunners have to dip their toes into Preston Garvey’s bullshit settlement stuff.

""Many [old] glitches are still relevant and abused."" One such glitch is called Load Warping, and it’s an exploit that allows the player to skip a lot of travel by messing with quick and hard saves. Load Warping made its debut in Oblivion , but wasn’t present in Fallout 3 and New Vegas . For whatever reason, though, it’s made a comeback in Fallout 4. Good thing, too: it’s useful for speedrunners.', '""I soon grew bored of going slow.""', 'Beyond using exploits, speedrunners like BubblesDelFuego also have to figure out the most optimal route.

The khanate expanded to the east and west, conquering the remainder of northwest China and pushing into Russia, aided by a wet period that allowed the Mongol armies to bring thousands of horses across the largest desert in Asia: the Gobi.', 'By 1240, Kiev had been sacked and the horde was rapidly advancing west. Their cavalry and siege tactics were laying waste to the cities of Europe, and, perhaps more importantly, they brought along Chinese gunpowder.', 'This series of unqualified successes brought the vast Mongol army to Hungary in March 1241. King Bela IV fled his palace in Pest (now Budapest), and Ogodei’s armies slaughtered an estimated 1 million Hungarians: Troops, clerics, nobles, knights, and peasants. It was one of the bloodiest defeats of the medieval period.', 'In December of 1241, Ogodei Khan died unexpectedly. Some historians have argued that Batu, Ogodei’s nephew who had been leading the western campaign, turned back toward the Mongol capital of Karakorum for the election of a new leader.', 'But Batu never returned returned to Mongolia, instead remaining in southern Russia to rule the Golden Horde. Meanwhile, Ogodei’s wife, Toregene, took power as the Great Khatun.', 'An abrupt end', 'The following year, everything changed.

Though subsequent khans staged occasional raids on European cities, the major war campaign was over.', 'Several hypotheses exist as to why the army abandoned their western front, but, the authors of the new paper argue, none are fully sufficient to explain the change in course.', 'The authors sampled wood from five regions of Eurasia to track what the weather was like during the period of the Mongols’ most extensive reach.', 'Sarah Kramer', 'Trees are especially sensitive to small changes in climactic conditions: in wet years, they add thick layers of bark to their trunks. In dry years, the rings are thinner, reflecting the lack of water to a tree.', 'They found the climate in Hungary and its surroundings were unusually cold and wet for about three years, from 1238 to 1241. The extra moisture and early spring thaw turned the Hungarian plains into marshes and swampland - unsuitable terrain for moving the thousands of horses the Mongol armies relied on for transportation and warfare.', 'The last year of the eastern European campaign, 1242, they note, was especially damp. This led to crop spoilage, further reducing the food supply for the khan’s hordes. Famine later set in and killed thousands in the region.', 'It’s likely that Ogodei’s commanders chose a southern route because of its relatively drier conditions, the authors write, directing them away from Europe.', 'What happened to the Mongols afterward?

The differences in health on a state level vary considerably. This year, Hawaii is the healthiest state in the country, while Mississippi is the least healthy state.', 'Most of the nation’s least healthy states suffer from the worst rates of diabetes, deaths from cancer and deaths from cardiovascular disease. In healthier states, such outcomes are far less common. For instance, eight of the 10 healthiest states also had among the 10 fewest cardiovascular deaths per 100,000 people.', 'The toll of poor health can cost, or significantly shorten, people’s lives. The Centers for Disease Control tracked premature death, which measures the number of years lost when people do not live to age 75. In the healthiest states, this number is quite low, with nearly all states in the bottom 15 nationwide. In America’s least healthy states, this number is far higher, with all but one state among the 10 worst nationwide. In the nation’s least healthy state, Mississippi, there were 10,821 years lost per 100,000 people, nearly twice the number of the country’s third healthiest state, Minnesota.', 'Behavior plays a major role in determining whether people stay healthy. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Dr. Reed Tuckson, external clinical advisor to United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings, explained, ""At the end of the day you’re not going to be able to turn around the diseases if you don’t deal with the risk factors.""', 'Nine of the 10 least healthy states in the nation had among the 10 worst obesity rates in the country.

At the other end, nearly all of the nation’s least healthy states had among the lowest incomes. The three least healthy states — Mississippi, Arkansas and Louisiana — were also the nation’s three poorest by median income. Residents’ ability to pay for health care, as well as the ability to afford a good education, which can affect good health decisions, are possible reasons for this relationship.', 'Tuckson added that the relationship between wealth and health could also be the result of lack of optimism poorer people may have. ""When you do not have great hope for the future, when you’re living a life that is not as optimistic, people are generally not as inclined to take charge of their overall health. ‘What’s the point,’ people will say. ‘If my life is miserable anyway, why would I do something to make myself live longer?’""', 'Access to quality care is also crucial. In states where residents are most likely to be healthy, there are usually high numbers of physicians and doctors. The opposite is true in the nation’s least healthy states. In places with limited access to quality care, residents are more likely to have children with low birth weight, and preventable hospitalizations are also more common. Hawaii, America’s healthiest state, had the lowest rate of preventable hospitalizations among Medicare recipients.', 'The relationship between good health and good policy, however, is hardly straightforward. While some healthy states provide a considerable amount of health funding, others do not. Hawaii spent more than any other state on health care at $225 per person from 2011 through 2012. However, Minnesota, the third healthiest state, spent less than $47 per person.

Yet about every minute, a woman in the United States dies from the condition. To increase awareness, New York–Presbyterian Hospital\'s Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute and the Barbra Streisand Women\'s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai have teamed up to launch the Women\'s Heart Alliance and a campaign called Fight the Ladykiller. The goal: to urge women to take heart health seriously. Start by answering these questions.', ""What's Your Daily Diet and Exercise Routine?"", 'If you eat more burgers than Brussels sprouts and can\'t remember the last time you broke a sweat, start small: ""Just going from no physical activity to 30 minutes of walking on most days may reduce premature death by more than 30 percent,"" says cardiologist Holly Andersen, MD, Director of Education and Outreach at the Perelman Heart Institute. ""And try to eat a slightly better diet. You can have ice cream -- just not every night.""', 'Do You Have an Autoimmune Disease?', 'If you\'re experiencing recurring symptoms that no one can diagnose (say, chronic fatigue or muscle aches), make sure your doctor has ruled out this type of disorder, which tends to strike women in their 20s to 40s. ""The leading hypothesis is that the chronic inflammation associated with these conditions is also a key player in heart disease,"" says Noel Bairey Merz, MD, director at the Streisand Women\'s Heart Center.', 'Are You a Smoker?', 'If you light up, let your doctor know. Pack-a-day smokers are more than twice as likely to have a heart attack as people who have never smoked.', ""What's Your Blood Pressure?"", 'This is one number everyone must know. Ideally, yours should be around or below 120/80.', ""What's Your Ten-Year Risk for Heart Disease?"", 'By plugging key health numbers (including blood pressure and cholesterol) and medical history (like whether you smoke or have diabetes) into a risk calculator, doctors can assess how likely you are to have a heart attack in the next decade. Have your risk checked annually.', 'Does Heart Disease Run in Your Family?', 'No? Great. Yes? Don\'t panic. ""Even if you have a terrible family history, your lifestyle -- what you eat, how much you exercise, how you manage stress -- is actually a more important factor,"" says Andersen. ""This is the best news, because your heart health is truly in your hands.""']",1
"[""You Won't Believe What Tesla Has Planned For Its Model Lineup""]","['Tesla’s new long-term manifesto, signaling the start of the company’s new direction for the next ten years. The manifesto, called ""Part Deux,"" is part of the Tesla Master Plan and it comes on the heels of the company completing ""Part One,"" which was released 10 years ago. There are a number of important details contained within the new plan, all of which are tied into the company’s overarching plan of creating a sustainable future for everyone in the planet. Tesla founder Elon Musk has released, signaling the start of the company’s new direction for the next ten years. The manifesto, called ""Part Deux,"" is part of the Tesla Master Plan and it comes on the heels of the company completing ""Part One,"" which was released 10 years ago. There are a number of important details contained within the new plan, all of which are tied into the company’s overarching plan of creating a sustainable future for everyone in the planet.', 'It might sound like an ambitious goal, but Tesla has proven in the past decade that its goals are less about meeting them one by one, but more about creating an ecosystem of change and advancement that ties every one of its goals together. So as the company prepares to embark on Part Deux of its master plan, it’s making clear that one of its goals is to expand its lineup and venture into new automotive segments. It’s already made an important imprint in the premium sedan and SUV markets, but now it’s eyeing more models, including a future compact SUV and a new pickup truck to add to its growing family of electric vehicles. But that’s just on the consumer side of things.', 'Just as important is the company’s goal of addressing other types of electric vehicles, most notable heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transports. According to Musk, both models are in the early stages of development and are primed to make their debuts some time in 2017. The Tesla Semi, in particular, is being prepared to provide a ""substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport to go with an increased priority in road safety."" Meanwhile, the urban transports are being developed to address the need to improve traffic congestion all over the world.', 'Coinciding with plans to venture into new automotive segments and providing real-world improvements to public transport, Tesla is also embarking on an equally ambitious goal of reinventing its production methods. A big part of this reinvention is to improve the machines that make the cars in an effort to make production faster and more efficient than the current setup. Being able to do this allows Tesla to increase the volume of production for its models, be it on the consumer side or the public utility side.', 'Continue reading for the full story.', 'Why it matters', 'If there’s one thing we’ve come to learn about Elon Musk and Tesla, it’s that we shouldn’t dismiss them and their ambitious goals. Many people did that 10 years ago and were proven wrong while watching Musk and Tesla accomplish its objectives one at a time. Some of the same people who criticized Tesla for its audacity back in 2006 probably own a Model S now.', 'In all seriousness, the Part Deux master plan is more than just laying out what the company plans to do for the next decade. It’s also a call-to-action for everybody to join the crusade of championing sustainability, not just in the automotive industry, but in other important aspects of life as well. Tesla’s message is clear. It wants to be considered a leader of change and it’s effectively telling everyone its plans on how it can accomplish its goals.', 'It’s a great message that a lot of people can get behind. Musk said it best when he explained the importance of achieving a sustainable energy economy. Not addressing it will eventually lead to the end of civilisation. It’s not the most massaged way to express that sentiment, but no amount of massaging the truth will change the fact that without purposefully addressing the need for sustainability, we’re effectively dooming ourselves.', 'That said, it’s no secret that there’s also a business side to this new master plan. Expanding its model lineup addresses that, especially if the company’s plans to launch a compact SUV and a pickup truck both come to fruition. The latter, in particular, would be an industry first and in this market alone where pickups are one of the most popular models, having an EV pickup truck that can perform like its gas-powered counterparts while effectively emitting no emissions is going to be a big hit. If anything, Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler should take heed of what Tesla’s planning to do.', 'Read our full review on the Tesla Pickup here.']",1
"['When Archaeologists Uncovered These 3,500-Year-Old Skeletons, What They Saw Left Them Gobsmacked']","['In the wilds of Siberia, a team of archaeologists is hard at work uncovering the graves of an ancient civilization. Slowly, the secrets of their burials are exposed for the first time in thousands of years. But when the graves are opened, a shocking revelation is hidden within...', 'Staryi Tartas is a village in Novosibirsk, a region of Southern Russia. Part of Western Siberia, it’s an area of little appeal to tourists. For archaeologists, however, it’s a completely different story.', 'In ancient times, the area around the village was a popular site for burials. It was so popular, in fact, that as many as 600 graves and tombs have been located in the vicinity. And now their mysteries have begun to see the light of day.', 'The burial sites are thought to date to the time of the so-called Andronovo culture, a catch-all term for several different but related cultures that existed in Western Siberia during the Bronze Age. By and large, they flourished between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago.', 'But back to the present day. In 2013 archaeologists from various European and Russian scientific institutes were conducting excavations at some of the grave sites. And what they subsequently found would transform their understanding of how the Andronovo cultures buried their dead.', 'In a significant number of tombs, archaeologists discovered the remains of couples who had been buried together, side by side. But it was how their bones had been arranged that was the most surprising thing.', 'The skeletal inhabitants of dozens of tombs had each been arranged so that they appeared to be embracing each other. Or, as writer Vasiliy Labetskiy subsequently wrote for the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, they had been positioned in ""post-mortal hugs with bony hands clasped together.""', 'In addition, archaeologists found various artifacts alongside the bodies. Yes, quantities of pottery, weapons and bronze ornaments were found within the graves, while pits containing animal bones were also discovered in the surrounding area.', 'Of course, it is not unusual for couples to choose to be buried together, with a widow or widower joining their partner in a shared grave once their time comes. But what made the discovery of these skeletons particularly creepy is the experts’ belief that they belong to people who were buried at the same time.', 'Now it’s unlikely that the members of any couple would pass away in unison, at least not of natural causes. So just what was the story behind the bizarre burials of Staryi Tartas?', 'Well, for one thing, archaeologists have been able to identify the burials as belonging to the Andronovo culture thanks to the positioning of the bodies. Why? Because while natives to the region buried their dead flat on their backs, the incoming Andronovo people arranged them on their sides – if they actually buried them at all.', 'More typically, people from the Andronovo culture were cremated – which raises even more questions as to the nature of these shared graves. And although no definitive answers have been found, archaeologists have offered up several possible explanations.', '""We can fantasize a lot about all this,"" Professor Vyacheslav Molodin of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, pictured, told the Siberian Times. ""We can allege that the husband died and the wife was killed to be interned with him as we see in some Scythian burials.""', 'Meanwhile, Professor Lev Klein from St. Petersburg State University has suggested that the unusual arrangements could be the result of practices similar to the Hindu ritual of deeksha. Rooted in beliefs about reincarnation and death as a second birth, such rites sometimes involved ritualistic sexual acts.', '""Perhaps in the pre-Vedic period,"" Klein told the Siberian Times, ""relatives of the deceased often sought to reproduce the deeksha posthumously, and sacrificed a woman or a girl (or a few), and simulated sexual intercourse in the grave.""', 'Now intriguingly, Deeksha developed on the Indian sub-continent, some 3,000 miles from Staryi Tartas. But some experts believe that the Andronovo people originally hailed from Iran and could have brought their ritualistic beliefs with them.', 'Meanwhile, the mysterious couples’ graves weren’t the only joint burials to be uncovered at the archaeological site. Indeed, researchers also found a man and a child entombed together – and, similarly, a woman and child.', '""What is [the] degree of their kinship?"" Molodin pondered. ""Are they father and son or...? The same question arises when we found a woman and a child. It should seem obvious – she is the mother. But it may not be so. She could be an aunt, or not a relative at all.""', 'In order to solve these questions, Molodin and his colleagues are turning to the emerging science of paleogenetics. By analyzing the remains, the team hope to be able to determine what, if any, kinship existed between two people interred in the same grave.', 'According to the Siberian Times, Molodin hoped to see results within five to ten years of the discovery in 2013. So for those intrigued by the notion of lovers locked forever in an eternal embrace, there may be even more of this fascinating story to come.']",1

The group that had a history of Viagra use had roughly double the risk of developing melanoma than those who hadn’t ever taken the drug, while those who were currently taking the drug had an 84 percent higher risk of developing melanoma, said the preliminary study, released Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.', 'Researchers said it’s still too early to alter prescriptions of the blue pill, but they urged increased investigation into its link to melanoma.', '""[P]eople who are on the medication and who have a high risk for developing melanoma may consider touching base with their primary care providers,"" Dr. Abrar Qureshi, co-author of the study and professor and chair of the dermatology department in the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, told NBC News.', 'Though melanoma accounts for less than 2 percent of skin cancer cases each year, it makes up the majority of skin cancer fatalities. According to the American Cancer Society’s most recent estimates, about 9,710 people are expected to die of melanoma this year; 6,470 of those are men.', 'The new study’s findings seem to fly in the face of a previously study that said Viagra could help defend against melanoma. In that 2011 study, conducted by Dr. Viktor Umansky and his team at the University Medical Center Mannheim, Viagra was shown to neutralize a melanoma tumor’s inflammatory immune response in a group of mice. However, as pointed out by Slate, there are many issues with medical trials on mice extending to human trial successes.']",1

['How Internet Porn Affects Romantic Life'],"['The world of internet pornography is a pervasive and wide reaching technology, growing at a breathtaking rate. It is a $13 billion-a-year industry in the US. Nine out of 10 boys in America are exposed to it before the age of 18, and men are 543% more likely to be users than women. By 2017, over a quarter of a billion people will use mobile porn sites worldwide.', 'With such an enormous audience, it is not possible to make generalisations about whether internet pornography is good or bad. Clearly, it’s a matter of perspective. Reviews have linked pornography consumption with positive effects such as increased sexual knowledge and more liberal sexual attitudes. But how does it shape our intimate relationships?', 'British Prime Minister David Cameron has expressed concern that internet pornography could be warping ideas about sex and relationships, and scientific evidence in this area tends to support his view. Links between pornography consumption and intimate relationship problems (although data typically refer to heterosexual, monogamous relationships) are well established.', 'Pornography consumption has been associated with increased marital distress, risk of separation, decreased romantic intimacy and sexual satisfaction, a higher chance of infidelity, and compulsive or addictive sexual behaviour. However, this does not automatically imply that internet pornography causes relational difficulties. Pornography consumption may equally be caused by them.', 'But if consumption does dampen romantic intimacy then it will be important to understand how. Harvard Psychology Professor Deirdre Barrett has suggested that internet pornography is a version of what scientists call a ""supernormal stimulus"". That is, an artificial exaggeration of the environmental factors from which we have naturally evolved to become sexually aroused.', 'Instinctive behaviour across a range of species can be hijacked when researchers create supernormal versions of normal stimuli. For example, while a female bird’s natural instinct is to nurture her small, speckled eggs, she will abandon them when presented with the option of larger, more heavily patterned artificial exaggerations of her eggs. Over time, she will lose interest completely in the normal eggs, as though her instinct towards them has been overridden by the supernormal ones.', 'In a similar (but more complex) way, internet pornography offers users a supernormal sexual experience. On one level, they become aroused by watching supernormal bodies having supernormal sex. On another level, they become accustomed to selecting these supernormal, virtual experiences from seemingly infinite options and have the possibility to refine, replay, pause, and rewind these virtual sexual experiences at will.', 'A major concern for sex and relationship therapists and researchers is that real people’s responses to real sex can indeed be dampened by overexposure to virtual sex. In his TED Talk, The Great Porn Experiment, Gary Wilson discusses arguments and evidence in support of porn induced erectile dysfunction. He highlights issues such as a numbed pleasure response and addictive craving for ""hits"" of pornographic material in heavy users.', 'Supernormal sex lives', 'The ways in which family life can be affected by these issues can be very powerful, too. A paper by sex therapist, Paula Hall, outlines the following typical case:', 'Tim was a 36-year-old man, married with two children aged one and three. He initially presented with erectile dysfunction but detailed assessment revealed that he had no problems with erections to pornography which he was now accessing most evenings for three or four hours at a time. He was very aware that his pornography use was getting in the way of him having sex with his wife and realised he’d got himself into a Catch 22. Watching increasingly hard-core porn was making him feel numb when having sex with his wife, but because sex with his wife was now so difficult, he was watching even more porn. In fact, the only times he could get an erection with his wife now was if he fantasised about porn which left him feeling guilty and distant from her.', 'Dampened responses to normal sex can result in intense feelings of guilt for users when sex with their partner isn’t as arousing as supernormal sex. There can also be attempts by users to make normal sex supernormal, either through fantasy or by manipulating reality.', 'Studies have also documented a deep rooted breakdown in trust and attachment, connected to the fact that partners frequently experience pornography consumption as a deceptive form of betrayal and infidelity. In the above study, one wife described her husband’s use of pornography as indiscriminate, virtual philandering and said that she felt like ""he’s had a million affairs.""', 'Ultimately, as cultural anthropologist, Mizuko Ito, has suggested: ""We have created these technologies but it’s not obvious how they evolve in and shape our culture."" Paradoxically, as connecting as technology may be, it is vital that we also understand and debate its role in creating and exacerbating disconnection.', 'Sam Carr, Lecturer in Education, University of Bath', 'This article was originally published on The Conversation.

Psychiatrist Jeremy Coplan studied patients with anxiety disorders and found that the people with the worst symptoms had higher IQ scores than those with milder symptoms. Other studies have found higher verbal IQ scores in people with higher levels of anxiety. And then there was a more complex experiment conducted at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel. Researchers asked participants to evaluate artwork presented by a software program and then triggered a fake computer virus, making it look as if it was the result of something that the participant did.

A recent study found that mice flown aboard the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth with the early signs of liver disease – and the animals were only off the planet for less than a fortnight."", 'After 13.5 days onboard the shuttle during its final flight in 2011, the mice were studied by a team of scientists including anaesthesiologist and physicist Karen Jonscher from the University of Colorado.

""We knew that astronauts often returned with diabetes-like symptoms, but they usually resolved quickly.""', ""Unlike other studies that have analysed the effects of cosmic radiation on mouse brains to see how exposure to space could impact the animals' cognitive abilities, the researchers don't think radiation is what caused the liver damage in this case."", ""The more likely culprit is the relative lack of gravity in a microgravity environment, which scientists think has a negative influence on the animals' metabolisms."", '""We saw the beginning of nascent liver damage in just 13.5 days,"" said Jonscher.

"[""Improve Your Home's Wi-Fi Signal in Five Minutes""]","['Wi-Fi is just radio waves, and many things can cause interference. But a strong Wi-Fi signal can give you faster performance and better coverage distance, so it’s important to properly position and configure your router for optimal signal strength. I’ll show you how; it just takes a few minutes.', 'Point the Antenna Up', 'Routers generally have physical antennas that are adjustable. The antenna often comes pointed horizontally to fit the router inside its box. For maximum signal strength, position your router’s antenna vertically, pointing straight up. If you have two antennas, you won’t get better performance by pointing them in different directions.', 'Position Your Router Properly', 'Consider where you put your router. If you have a large home or office, place the router close to the center to maximize coverage. If you position the router at one end of the building, you may have poor (or no) signal at the other end.But keep in mind that if you already have your router positioned at one end of your home and the signal strength is just fine on the other side, you don’t need to move it.', 'For maximum coverage, the router should also be high up. Placing it on the floor is the worst location possible – place it on a high shelf, if possible.', 'Don’t place the router on or near large metal objects, such as metal shelves or filing cabinets. These can block the signal. Metal or stone walls can also block Wi-Fi, while wood and plaster walls won’t cause any problems.', 'You might be able to root out other sources of interference. For example: microwave ovens, 2.4 GHz cordless phones, and 2.4 GHz baby monitors all have the potential to interfere with a Wi-Fi signal. I’ve personally experienced a Wi-Fi signal to my laptop dying every time a microwave oven was turned on. The microwave oven was in direct line-of-sight between my laptop and the router. The solution? Move any one of them so that the microwave isn’t in between. If you get interference from a cordless phone, you might want to purchase newer 5.8 GHz cordless phones; these workon a frequency band other than Wi-Fi and don’t cause any interfere.', 'Choose the Best Wi-Fi Channel', 'If you’re in an area with many different Wi-Fi networks — such as an apartment complex or even just a house close to other homes — your neighbors’ Wi-Fi networks are probably interfering with yours.', 'To minimize this, move your router further away from the other Wi-Fi access points, if you can. For example, if you’re in an apartment and have a router in the corner of your room, your neighbor’s router might be right on the other side of the wall.', 'But the best thing you can do is switch to a different Wi-Fi channel. You access this option on your router’s settings page — check your router’s instruction manual for instructions on how to do that. (If you don’t have the instruction manual, you can almost certainly find the instructions online.) Locate the Wi-Fi channel option in the router’s web interface and change it to a different channel with less interference.', 'It might take a little experimentation to find the best one, but you can get help choosing a Wi-Fi channel using the Wi-Fi Analyzer app for Android phones and tablets, which will monitor the Wi-Fi networks near you and recommend the least-cluttered Wi-Fi channel for your network. Unfortunately, similar apps aren’t available for iPhone or iPad due to the limitations Apple places on app developers.', 'That’s it — all you really have to do is position your router well and choose the ideal Wi-Fi channel to optimize your network. Of course, buying a new router that supports modern, improved Wi-Fi standards may also offer you a signal strength and speed boost.']",1

As Apple has printed money with the iPhone, it has sucked profits out of its suppliers and the wireless providers."", ""This is the deal, like it or lump it. But Cook isn't a person who brims with mad visions and wants to take wild risks. If he were, Apple would be selling a TV now instead of an overpriced digital watch."", 'Musk works for no man', ""When Musk started PayPal, he was part of an oddball genius collective that included Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, both offbeat personalities (Levchin was born in the old USSR and his parents fled, while Thiel is among the world's most prominent and wealthiest libertarians)."", ""These guys still don't work for anybody, and probably never will.

The Apple Watch isn\'t creating an iPhone-like ecosystem of must-have wearable technology; nobody knows what\'s really going on with ""Project Titan,"" the Apple-car project; the obvious move into TV doesn\'t look as if it is ever going to happen; music streaming and other ""tech"" services are boring and unromantic.', ""No one should be surprised. Cook isn't an idea guy.

Apple is in the beautiful-things business, as is Tesla, and that's one of the arguments that drives the takeover talk. But Cook doesn't want to be in the position of buying Tesla and seeing Musk turn into the new Jobs."", 'Musk needs to keep Tesla independent', 'Tesla is just one piece of Musk\'s grand vision, which is to accelerate humanity\'s escape from a dependence on fossil fuels. Tesla\'s role is to spur the arrival of widespread electrification in the world\'s fleet of vehicles. Even though Musk now wants Tesla to be delivering 500,000 vehicles by 2020, the goal isn\'t for Tesla to be the Toyota of EVs. SpaceX\'s job is to ""back up the biosphere,"" according to Musk, and make the species multiplanetary — in case the earth\'s environment is rendered uninhabitable for humans.', ""Musk's companies serve a larger purpose. But if Apple were to buy Tesla, the acquisition would have to make some contribution to Apple's business, preferably a tangible one. I'm not sure that Apple would be satisfied with having the first Genius Bar on Mars."", 'Cook is a relatively normal person', ""No CEO of a major tech company has any hope of living a normal life, but Cook seems to exhibit none of Jobs' eccentricities. He likes fitness and appears to live modestly. He's among the prominent gay executives in business, but his sexuality isn't anything that has provoked controversy. He presents Apple's products cheerfully. He has been an excellent steward of what Jobs and his Apple cofounders created."", 'Musk is an exceptionally unusual person', 'There are many reasons why. I\'ll muster a single example: After he sold PayPal, Musk taught himself rocket design by reading old Russian rocket manuals. Maybe another: On earnings calls with analysts, he loves nothing more than to dig down into the technical minutiae of Tesla\'s vehicles. He lives the life of a tech celebrity: Robert Downey Jr. modeled Tony Stark from ""Iron Man"" on Musk; he\'s been married several times; he has six kids; he splits his time between Silicon Valley and Beverly Hills; he sleeps next to his Tesla assembly lines; he oversees SpaceX launches. He is by all accounts a wonderful father and decent person, although demanding to work for, but he\'s not spending many quiet evenings at home.', ""So if Apple were to buy Tesla, someone would have to go, and that someone would be Musk. And Musk doesn't want to go."", ""That said, there's no shortage of auto-industry veterans who think it's time for Musk to give up the big chair. And in the unlikely event that it happens, there would be one obvious plus: Musk could be all-in on SpaceX's race to put people on Mars.""]",1

['These 6 systems will get rid of Wi-Fi dead spots in your house'],"['As history flows along, we find ways to snuff out conditions that make us miserable. We invented plumbing so we didn’t have to carry water. We invented tractors so we didn’t have to break our backs in the fields. We invented air conditioning so we’re no longer uncomfortable in the summer.', 'And now, you are alive to see the snuffing out of another source of misery: Wi-Fi dead spots.', 'For years, we’ve tried to solve this problem with various imperfect solutions like Wi-Fi repeaters/extenders. But they all have downsides, like diminished speed and having to change Wi-Fi network names when you move around the house.', 'But now, there’s mesh Wi-Fi.', 'Instead of one Wi-Fi transmitter too weak to fill your entire home with signal, a mesh system uses a set of them, spaced evenly through your house. The result is a single ""mesh network,"" a roaming network, that blankets the entire house in good, strong signal.', 'The revolution began a year ago with the introduction of the Eero. After I tested it (my review’s here), I was so exhilarated that I actually bought a set for myself, at the nosebleedy price of $500.', 'Today, every networking company and its sister now offers a similar system. And man, they are great.', 'Because a router out in plain sight offers better coverage than one in a closet, they’re all great-looking. Because we’re human beings and not engineers, they all include phone apps that make setup simple. And because many of us have children, most offer either parental controls (to block iffy websites) or a Pause button for specified offspring (so we can have dinner conversation face to face).', 'This week, I reviewed six of these systems: Eero, Plume, Luma, Google WiFi, Netgear Orbi, LinkSys Velop, and Ubiquiti Amplifi HD.', 'Each manufacturer touts its routers’ top speed in megabits per second (""867 mbps/sec!"", for example). But trust me: You’ll get those speeds only on the moon. In the cluttered airwaves of a community, among the walls and furniture obstacles of a home, your top speed will probably be less than half the advertised maximum. Move 30 feet away, and it drops by half again.', 'In fact, any of these mesh systems can pass along data faster than your Internet provider passes it into the average American home (54 mbps/sec.). If your concern is transferring files between drives within your home, or if you’re paying for much faster Internet, then consider one of the beefier systems here: The Velop, Orbi, or Amplifi HD.', 'I tested each system by wandering through my house with a laptop running Netspot, an app that builds a ""heat map"" of Wi-Fi strength. All of them totally blanketed both floors of the house. (I even spot-checked the attic and basement. They had Wi-Fi, too.)', 'I also did an internet speed test twice per system: in the room closest to the cable modem, and the room farthest from it. Here’s what I discovered.', 'The modules are small and good-looking; the terrific app gives you insight into every aspect of your system. All the key features are here, like guest networks (for visitors—they can access the internet, but not your computers) and individual, pause-able profiles for your offspring.', 'If you have an Amazon (AMZN) Echo, you can even control your Eeros by voice: shutting off certain kids’ internet access, turning the Eeros’ status lights on or off, or finding your phone/tablet/laptop in the house according to its closest Eero.', 'The Eero’s price has not come down in its year on the market, though. At $500 for a set of three, it’s almost goofily overpriced—$200 more than Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Wi-Fi, for example. I’m glad to own it, but it wouldn’t be my first choice today.', 'Google’s Eero-like system costs $300 for the set of three.', 'It, too, is fast, full-featured, and beautifully designed. (For example, there’s no traditional power brick—only a simple cord with USB-C on the router end and standard two-prong plug on the other.)', 'The app makes it incredibly simple to set the whole thing up. You use your phone to scan a barcode on the bottom of the first pod; after that, one tap is all it takes to set up each additional pod. The app even tests the placement of each unit and lets you know if you’ve chosen wisely.', 'Features: You can pause individuals or groups, even remotely. You can control the colorful LED ring around the equator of each unit, although they make fantastic night lights. Voice control is coming soon, Google says. Port forwarding, guest networking, device prioritization (""favor the Roku when I’m watching videos!""): all present.', 'Feels like a cheap Eero knockoff; minor irritations abound. Do I really have to surrender my phone number just to use my new router? The units are hexagons, but unlike the Eeros, they can’t lie flat, because the power cord sticks out of the back. The setup process goes like this.', 'The app is strong on parental controls and security; for example, you can set up accounts for each kid in your family and specify what kinds of sites they’re allowed to visit (rated PG, R, etc.). And there’s a full list of management features: Alexa commands (""Alexa, tell Luma to pause Casey’s laptop""), gadget prioritization, port forwarding, and guest networks.', 'But the Lumas’ power is on the weak side; a set of three left fading signal at the fringes of the house.', 'Netgear’s approach to mesh networking is radical: Only two units to cover an entire big house. Including the front and back yard!', 'How? First, these are big, honking towers, crammed with antennas and power to drive them. (A ring on the top glows in colors during setup to show its happiness with the current signal strength.)', 'Second, most routers communicate with your devices on one of two radio bands (2.4 or 5 gigahertz)—but this one uses a third channel exclusively for communications between the two towers. As a result, that channel remains strong enough to drive through ceilings, floors, and walls. Netgear suggests putting one unit right by your cable modem, and the ""satellite"" tower in the middle of your house, even if that’s upstairs and several rooms away.', 'It works. (The ""Mesh routers"" heat map shown near the top of this article is the Orbi’s result.)', 'By the way, the Orbi also offers MU-MIMO streaming. (That stands for Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output, but it basically means fast—at least when talking to gadgets that also speak MU-MIMO. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and certain other Android phones do; no Apple products do.)', 'Alas, Netgear’s software engineers aren’t anywhere near as impressive as its hardware designers. The setup instructions are filled with terms like ""credentials"" and ""redirect,"" and they make no mention of a smartphone app that could make the process easier. You’re supposed to use a web-browser interface to set up your Orbis.', 'When I contacted the company, they told me that there is a setup app—they just forgot to mention it! In fact, there are three apps, each governing a different aspect of the Orbis (setting up guest network, parental controls, etc.).', 'Come on, people. You can do better.', 'For $490, you get three gorgeous, sculptural white towers, with cables that sneak out of a corner cutout, a physical reset button (instead of a paper-clip hole), and packaging that out-elegances Apple’s. The towers deliver fantastic speed and coverage, thanks in part to a three-band system like Netgear’s for better comms between towers.', 'The Velop (pronounced VELLup) also offers MU-MIMO streaming, if you’re scoring at home.', 'All the perks are here: parental controls, guest networking, device prioritization, port forwarding, Alexa commands (""Turn the guest network on,"" ""What’s my password?""), and so on. The app is, therefore, more dense than on simpler devices, but it’s not hard to navigate.', 'My one beef: it takes a long time to recognize each new satellite as you hook it up. Minutes.', 'If you took the concept of mesh routers—multiple transmitters spaced around the home—to its logical conclusion, you’d wind up with Plume. Here, you buy a bunch of super-cheap, tiny routers—the size of night lights, available in black, silver, or bronze—and plug them directly into power outlets, one per room or hallway! (Once you’re about a room away from the nearest Plume, your signal weakens dramatically.)', 'Setting them up is insanely easy. You don’t even have to introduce them to the network one at a time, as you must the other systems; you can just plug in all six, or all nine, or whatever, and they just work. (If you want to name them, you can: Just hold your phone very close to one of the plugs until it offers its name for changing. Very cool.)', 'These pods are so cheap because they don’t contain processors, as their rivals do; all the analysis is done online. As a result, the company says that it takes 24 hours of analysis before the plugs begin to deliver their best speeds. Then, in the coming weeks, they shift bandwidth to the pods that need it most, according to your use patterns.', 'Here’s the problem, though: Economics. If your home is small enough that you can get by with three Plumes ($180) or even six ($330), you’d save money and complexity by buying a modern, standard, regular router. And if your house is big enough that you need a mesh system, you’ll probably need $600 worth of Plumes—and any of the competitors here would cost a lot less than that.', 'There are no features to speak of, either: No guest network, device prioritization, or parental controls.', 'Here’s another fresh take on the mesh system. This time, the three modules aren’t identical and interchangeable. There’s a base module and two satellite antennas.', 'The base is a cube with a color touch screen; tap it to view various network-info screens. (Most of the time, it just shows the time and date.)', 'The satellites are very cool: the antenna part connects to the power-outlet part with a magnetic ball joint, meaning that you can adjust the antenna’s angle. Note, though, that it can be tough finding spots to plug these things in where they’re not stymied by a floor, a countertop, or a wall. Baseboard outlets are pretty much it—which limits your positioning options (and attracts small children). They’re not exactly fashion accessories, either.', 'The app is lovely, and gives you access to all kinds of advanced router settings (port forwarding, DHCP settings, etc.)—but doesn’t offer parental controls.', 'If money were no object, I’d tell you to buy the LinkSys Velop. These babies look great, they’re absurdly fast, the features are all there, and the software has its act together. A set of three is designed to cover 6,000 square feet of house—far more than the Google WiFi (4,500 square feet), Netgear Orbi (4,000), or Eero or Luma (3,000). (Then again, if your pad is more of a palace, you ‘ll want the Amplifi HD, which says it can cover 20,000 square feet!)', 'But if money is an object—namely, if you object to a $490 price tag—then you can save $200 by getting the Google WiFi trio. The modules are gorgeous and not so ostentatious, and the app offers a smoother setup.', 'Unfortunately, the three-pack of Google WiFi is currently sold out everywhere. If you can’t wait, you can save almost as much money, and still get unbelievable coverage, with the Amplifi HD ($350) or the Netgear Orbi ($380).', 'In any case, if your house’s size or construction stymies any single router you’ve tried, treat yourself. Dead spots are the latest scourge of humanity that we’ve now wiped out.']",1
['This step of Manohar Parrikar is women empowerment in true sense - The Frustrated Indian'],"['Thanks to people like Rahul Gandhi and the hypocrite feminists (Feminazis in popular lingo), women empowerment is more of a joke than a cause to be taken up. They way these two have dealt with the subject is not only deplorable; it is laughable to say the least. However, trust people like Manohar Parrikar to bring back the sanity to this subject.', 'If sources are to be believed, Manohar Parrikar our defense ministers has proposed an all women’s battalion in all the three forces, for combat purposes.', 'In a seminar organized by FICCI FLO, the IIT Mumbai (then Bombay) graduate and ex CM of Goa said, ""There is a thinking that soldiers will not listen to a Commanding Officer who is a lady because they are not trained to do that. I don’t agree with this as the only restriction today is infrastructure,""', '""In combat roles also there can be women. Why not have a complete women team, battalion of women. So the question of women officers leading a men’s team, if there is question of initial resistance to it, can also be taken care of,"" he said.', 'What does this mean?', 'This implies that Manohar Parrikar is advocating for a complete women’s battalion, especially in all the armed forces, whether Army, Navy or Air Force. He said that a psychological barrier for the same has been broken by the induction of Bhavana Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi into the Indian Air Force as the fighter pilots.', 'Mooting for an all women’s battalion is nothing new to India. Much before women were officially inducted, our esteemed revolutionary, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, advocated for participation of women in his struggle for independence. True to his words, he also constituted an all women and girls regiment, named the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, comprising future heroines like Chief of Medical Staff, Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan, Lieutenant Manvati Arya, famous teen spy Saraswathi Rajamani among others.', 'Recently, post the ascent of Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of India in 2014, women are being gradually, but significantly being allowed more say in the defence sector. 2015 Republic Day Celebrations saw a drastic change, when Wing Commander Pooja Thakur was assigned the command of the Guard of Honor, normally a male only bastion. If that was enough, for the first time, an all women’s contingent from each of the armed forces marched down the Rajpath at the Republic Day Celebrations, with Captain Divya Ajith leading the Army contingent, Lieutenant Commander Sandhya Chauhan leading the Navy contingent and Squadron Leader Sneha Shekhawat leading the Air Force contingent.', 'Although in the words of Manohar Parrikar, it would happen gradually, but if it becomes the reality, India would become the latest entrant in the select club of nations having an all women’s battalion for combat purposes. Besides, Shri Manohar Parrikar has also proposed the idea of inducting women through the National Defence Academy and Sainik schools.', 'Ruing that the bureaucratic corruption compelled the file on induction of women to reach him after nearly four months, despite his own personal interest into the same, Shri Parrikar said, ""I support women rights, empowerment but I believe changes have to be done in a gradual manner because if you don’t do that there will be problems,"" he said.', 'As of now, women are not permanently inducted into the Indian Army, and as per the Short Service Commission, serve the tenure of barely 5 to 15 years. However, in the medical sector, they are allowed for Permanent Commission and pension after retirement. They are eligible to compete only through the Combined Defence Services Exam, and not the NDA one. Shri Parrikar’s interest will break all these barriers, if they turn into the reality.', 'What Manohar Parrikar is signaling towards is a radical step that will give women a genuine chance to serve the nation. In a country rife with tales of women warriors, from the mythological Kaikeyi, to the brave tribal queen Durgavati, this is nothing short of a cultural victory. Even though it is a tough task ahead, we are proud of Shri Manohar Parrikar, that he is personally interested in this case.

The wine is made from ""premium French grapes"" in southern France, the manufacturer says, but it considers the beverage a ""wine drink"" or a ""wine product"" since it has less than half the alcohol content of a normal glass of wine.', 'Each serving also has half the calories of a regular glass. The wine drink comes in a 8.4-oz. slim can -- the same size as a Red Bull -- that includes two servings, and will be sold for less than $3 per can or less than $6 for a two-pack.', 'Friends Beverage Group CEO Joe Peleg, originally from Israel and a 1980s graduate of Cornell University, launched the product earlier in 2013. Peleg said in a recent visit to The Huffington Post headquarters that his goal is to make wine more accessible and common for Americans to have with their lunch or dinner.', '""We want this to be something light ... something that you enjoy with friends,"" Peleg said.', 'HuffPost editors tried Original Red Sangria, Original White Sangria, Rosé Moscato, White Moscato, Strawberry Moscato and Peach Moscato flavors, all 6 percent alcohol by volume. The company also makes Cabernet Merlot, French Melon Wine and Chardonnay Sauvignon flavors, which are 12 percent alcohol by volume.', 'Reactions from HuffPost editors and writers were mixed. Two staffers who cover food said they were not impressed. ""It\'s like adult Capri Sun,"" one said.

Part of this, people have theorized, is that Americans today are more health conscious. Even among people drinking beer, light versions are outselling full lagers."", 'In the next couple weeks, Peleg expects to see his products roll out in CVS stores around New York City. Since Friends is actually a ""wine drink"" with an alcohol level closer to beer\'s than normal vino\'s, it can be sold in convenience stores while brands like Yellowtail and Franzia cannot.', ""The Friends' moscato flavors are already sold on Spirit Airlines for $7, and the company doesn't think it's out of the question to have wine products sold domestically at fast food chains like McDonald's within a few years.

Men, on the other hand, don't seem to be fazed by women's ability to tell a good tale."", 'Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and SUNY Buffalo came to these conclusions after conducting a series of studies with hundreds of male and female undergrads as participants.', ""In one study, undergrads read descriptions of men and women, some of which specified that the man or woman tells great stories. Results showed that women found men who were good storytellers more attractive as long-term partners than men who were only decent storytellers, or men whose bios didn't mention storytelling ability at all."", ""Men, on the other hand, didn't rate women more attractive when those women were described as good storytellers."", 'The researchers also asked the participants to indicate whether they thought the man or woman would be popular, admired, and a good leader. Answers to these questions indicated how high-status the person seemed.', 'Sure enough, men who were supposedly good storytellers were perceived by women as higher status. Again, though, women who were supposedly good storytellers were not perceived by men as more attractive or of higher status.', 'At this point, it\'s hard to say for sure why women are drawn to men who can tell a good story. The authors suggest that ""storytelling ability reflects a man\'s ability to gain resources. Good storytellers may be more likely to influence others or to gain positions of authority in society.""', ""Previous research has found that women prefer high-status guys, so this isn't especially surprising — what's new is the idea that storytelling ability is an indicator of status."", ""Of course, future research is necessary to see if watching and listening to a man tell a story is as appealing as reading a story he's written."", ""Yet this study adds to a growing body of research on the nonphysical characteristics that can make men attractive to women, like mindfulness and altruism. In some cases, these attributes seem to be even more important than a man's looks."", 'Bottom line: Women might not explicitly reveal that they\'re looking for a guy who can tell a good story — in fact, they might not even realize that\'s what they want.

['Chelsea Handler Admits Something Most Women Are Afraid To.'],"['Over the weekend, famed female talk show host Chelsea Handler shared a piece of her private history with the world. In an essay published on Playboy’s website, the comedian best known for her brash, take-no-prisoners tone, shared that at the age of 16, she underwent not one but two abortions:', '""I was going through a very bad stage in my life. I hated my parents and I was having unprotected sex with my boyfriend, who was not someone I should’ve been having sex with in the first place, nevermind unprotected sex. I wasn’t really playing with a full deck of cards.""', 'This essay does not mark the first time Handler has opened up about abortion. In a 2012 interview with Rosie O’Donnell, Handler said, ""You should do whatever you want with your body and you shouldn\'t let anyone tell you what to do."" But the Playboy essay reveals some startling new information—Handler admitted to a second pregnancy by the same young man, along with a subsequent abortion.', '""Getting unintentionally pregnant more than once is irresponsible, but it’s still necessary to make a thoughtful decision. We all make mistakes all the time. I happened to fuck up twice at the age of 16. I’m grateful that I came to my senses and was able to get an abortion legally without risking my health or bankrupting myself or my family. I’m 41 now. I don’t ever look back and think, God, I wish I’d had that baby.""', 'Handler’s confession is already inciting ire across the web:', 'Clearly, Handler has struck a nerve. Yet people seem to be missing what might actually be the heart of Handler’s essay. Near the end of the piece, she makes some pretty bold observations about our political discourse surrounding women and the legislation of their bodies:', '""I don’t buy that Roe v. Wade is in danger. We’re too far ahead of the game. Once you go forward in history, you don’t go backward. That would be like the government saying, ‘Okay, we’re taking away your right to vote too.’ You can’t introduce a black person and be like, ‘Oh, I just got a slave!’ That era is over. It’s similar to what’s happening in Mississippi and some other states with gay-marriage discrimination—marriage equality is going to take. You can’t stop that. We’ve already made the decision, and now we’re moving on to transgender rights. And it’s a wrap on men deciding what women can do with their bodies.""', 'The thing is, though, it isn’t a wrap. As Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a 2014 Washington Post opinion piece, ""Since 2011, more than half the states in the nation have significantly restricted access to abortions. That’s more restrictions in the past three years than were enacted in the previous decade.""', 'Northup added that the ""hollowing"" of Roe v. Wade by these restrictive laws was a ""new tactic [seeking] legitimate cover for the illegitimate goal of denying significant numbers of American women access to safe, legal, essential reproductive health care.""', 'However, perhaps in small part due to women like Handler opening up about their own reproductive needs and rights, the tides may be changing. While Handler’s view may be a wildly optimistic take on America, politicians, and the constituents they represent, for now, politicians appear to be on women’s side. Just this week, the Supreme Court had to step in to strike down a Texas abortion access law that would have likely shut down most, if not all, of the clinics in the state.', 'The biggest takeaway here might be that the more women open up about their experiences with abortion, the easier it will be for everyone to accept it as our new normal. Luckily, more women will be sharing their abortion stories starting August 12, when HBO releases its latest documentary, Abortion: Stories Women Tell in select theaters across the country. As the film’s release material describes, Abortion will focus ""not on the debate, but rather on the women themselves: those struggling with unplanned pregnancies, and the providers who show up at clinics to give medical care, as well as the activists on both sides of the issue, hoping to sway decisions and lives.""', 'Perhaps by continuing to tell their truthful stories women will win the right to no longer have to discuss their own bodies with the world.']",1

Most of these nations, including the most populous, also have low fertility rates compared with the global average.

Historically, there have been about 105 boys born for every 100 girls, and this leads to more males than females in younger age groups. At the same time, women have lower premature mortality rates than men and tend to live longer, leading to a higher number of older females than older males. We created an alternative list of age-standardized gender ratios (.xlsx) for each country (though we didn’t use it in the analysis for this post) by weighting the gender ratios so that each country has an age distribution more closely aligned with the world’s age distribution overall. After the adjustments, former USSR nations disappeared from the list of top 15 countries that have the fewest number of men per women. That’s because the Soviet bloc is older than much of the world, skewing its population more female.', 'Younger men in the former Soviet Union also have an unusually high mortality rate, which has widened the population’s gender imbalance. One way to see this is to look at the life expectancy of men and women and the differences between those numbers.', 'Russian women born from 2010 to 2015 are expected to live to age 75.6, while Russian men are expected to live to age 64.2, a gap of 11.4 years. Other former USSR countries, such as Belarus, Ukraine and Latvia, have similarly high gaps, with many men in this area losing their lives to alcohol-related incidents, suicides and diseases, among other causes (as noted by demographer Murray Feshbach). The only nation with a higher life-expectancy gap between genders is war-torn Syria.', 'Alcoholism has long been a problem in the former USSR, especially for young men. A 2014 study in The Lancet medical journal found evidence that excess vodka use is a top killer in Russia, responsible for a disproportionate amount of deaths among Russian men. And a 2013 Pew Research Center survey found a stark gender divide on attitudes toward drinking in Russian society: 52% of women believe that drinking alcohol is morally unacceptable, compared with just 36% of men who say the same.', 'Topics: Birth Rate and Fertility, Demographics, Gender, Population Geography, Population Trends, Russia']",1

['How one CS:GO player took catching hackers into his own hands'],"[""Cheating in CS:GO is its own small sub-industry, a hard-to-kill parasite riding on the skin one of the PC’s most popular games. Some ne'er-do-wells get off avoiding the notice of the VAC system for as long as possible. Others leverage cheating as a profitable enterprise , offering premium programs and services. Some professionals have even used cheats during competition (with disastrous , career-ending consequences ). For Valve, combating the risk of hacking is an endless war. Just last week, Valve’s elimination of a popular Team Fortress 2 cheat nabbed nearly 170 pro TF2 players. And last year, it dealt over 1 million bans to suspected accounts; with ownership counts likely exceeding 20 million , CS:GO likely represents a significant chunk of that figure."", 'Earlier this year, CS:GO player AndroidL was inspired to take matters into his own hands. In late January, AndroidL created and dispersed a pair of free hack programs on a popular cheat forum. Unbeknownst to their downloaders, the programs were time bombs. They’d function normally for a set period of time before permanently skewing the user’s view angle to an abnormal tilt and enabling a constant bunnyhop script—huge, obvious red flags that would immediately trigger a VAC ban. Although clever, the first few hack releases earned modest attention—roughly 1,000 downloads apiece, according to AndroidL’s Reddit post .', '""CS:GO has a cheating problem,"" AndroidL explained to me over multiple private messages. ""I don’t think Valve is doing enough to prevent cheating; it doesn’t speak publicly about VAC (for obvious reasons) or cheating in general. For such a competitive game with such an active and thriving community, Valve fails to at least acknowledge cheating is an issue in CS:GO which is appalling. Due to their failure to communicate, we aren\'t sure if Valve are actually attempting to combat cheaters or not. It\'s impossible to play a game of CS:GO today without suspecting someone on the enemy team of cheating.""', ""AndroidL used this chart taken from vac-ban.com to illustrate the impact of each hack's release."", 'AndroidL’s hack took a more direct approach. It dispensed with timers and prompted a ban the moment a user would load the hack and enter a match by continuously topping off health, ammo, and armor values. Yet despite the almost instant effect, it achieved greater success, accumulating over 3,500 downloads.', 'Contributing to the hack’s propagation was a simple testing method: ""I set the launch options of CS:GO to ‘+sv_lan 1 -insecure’ which disables VAC (but consequently prevents me from joining any VAC enabled servers),"" AndroidL wrote. ""This means I can test the hacks without getting banned. I just played an offline game with bots where I was able to confirm the features such as editing my view angles along with health and ammo numbers.""', 'Once the hack’s usability was confirmed, AndroidL uploaded it onto the cheat forum through a VPN to stay anonymous. The forum account ""was only days old with no reputation,"" which would typically undermine the legitimacy of the hack. But to promote the hack, AndroidL went for a straightforward solution: ""I had a few of my friends post messages such as ‘great, the hack worked!’ and so on until the comments overflowed onto a second page. Most hackers don’t check the second page of posts; they’ll only read the first few comments and then download the hack."" As publicly released programs tend to last only a few days before detection by VAC, dummy nods of approval was enough to push the scheme in front of as many eyes as possible while it lasted.', 'AndroidL’s favorite forum complaint. ""It\'s strange how people think they\'re entitled to free hacks, as if someone else is to blame for the consequences of their cheating.""', 'And it worked. The hack’s impact was magnified by its sheer efficiency; a cheater couldn’t react fast enough between launching CS:GO and meeting VAC’s awaiting hammer seconds later. As bans started snowballing, users flooded the host forum with warnings and grievances of their sudden downfall. AndroidL feigned innocence by ""coming up with excuses as to why it wasn\'t my hack banning people to encourage others to download it.""', 'Members of the CS:GO community could already participate in culling the cheater population through Valve’s Overwatch initiative for a few years now, but AndroidL’s accomplishments demonstrate how one can more surgically hamper hackers with only modest extra effort. The victory could very well be temporary at best—devoted cheaters can simply create a fresh Steam account and spend the $15/£11 on another CS:GO copy—but from AndroidL’s perspective, the self-demise of those who sought an ostensibly easy access to a hack was worth it.', ""The skewed view that a hacker would eventually see with AndroidL's hack."", '""I think Overwatch is a very good idea,"" AndroidL wrote. ""It\'s another filter cheaters have to go through, but the only reason Overwatch exists is because VAC lacks the capabilities to detect all cheaters. Although I believe VAC is a good safeguard against cheaters, I don’t believe it is a strong enough safeguard. There is little to no effort involved for a hack developer to bypass VAC—it is a decent system to keep away the masses of people using public cheats, but other than that VAC is essentially futile.', '""I do have a plan with similar tactics and I probably will do this again sometime,"" AndroidL continued. ""It would be great if I could cooperate with Valve to get a larger number of cheaters banned. Taking cheating into our own hands seems to be the only solution right now, and I encourage others that have the skills to do this to create similar fake hacks. Furthermore, I want to put off those thinking about cheating. This wasn’t the first fake hack, and it definitely won’t be the last.""']",1
['How Dogs Find Their Way Home (Without A GPS)'],"['Animals’ ability to navigate long distances has long been shrouded in mystery. From the skill of racing pigeons to find their way home, to the seasonal breeding migration of the humpback whale, a huge range of creatures are capable of navigating in a consistent, precise and effective way.', 'Science has been slow to fully identify and understand the processes and cues involved in animal migration. However, evidence now suggests that a vast array of species, from beetles to birds to dogs, demonstrate amazing abilities to travel long distances, without the use of electronic GPS – something many humans have perhaps become over-reliant upon.', 'In April, the story of Pero, an adventurous four-year-old working sheepdog was reported. Pero managed to find his way from Cockermouth in Cumbria back to his previous home, near Aberystwyth, on the coast of mid Wales. In a real-life story reminiscent of ""Lassie Come Home"", Pero somehow navigated about 240 miles in two weeks. Significantly, his microchip confirmed this was not a case of mistaken identity, this young sheepdog really had made it back to his first home.', 'Stories like that of Pero’s often attract media interest, leaving readers puzzled over how an animal can travel so far. Without speculating over whether the dog had been simply dropped off at the farm by someone who recognised him, these sorts of tales apparently prove the remarkable nature of animal instincts. The deep relationship between people and their dogs also seems to drive a desire to believe that there is something magical about this ability. So, is this navigation skill because of ""personal bonds"" between owner and dog, or is there a scientific understanding of the biology involved?', 'Sniffing out adventure. www.shutterstock.com/Kevin Lobene', 'A huge variety of animals use a number of different sensory systems in order to travel distances. Desert ants, for example, use environmental olfactory cues and odour plumes – clouds of scent dispersed by the wind moving odour molecules – to navigate their way both to food sources and back to their nests. Honeybees appear able to recall routes to feeding sites when exposed to scent from that location. Other species such as sea turtles, some amphibians, spiny lobsters and birds are able to use magnetic positional information to migrate or orientate towards specific target locations. This latter ability to exploit geomagnetic information is significant, as it is unlikely to be affected by weather conditions, cycles of light and dark, seasonality or global position in the same way that other cues might be affected.', 'In addition to a ""magnetic compass"", birds also appear to use sun and star ""compasses"" for navigation. Parasitic nematode worms are capable of moving towards new hosts by responding to seismic vibrations and other species use vibrations for prey capture. Bats, birds and marine mammals can also identify location and travel with the help of sonar and infrasound, while visual landmarks appear critical for species such as ourselves.', 'Pero’s tale.', 'But just how did Pero find his way home? It is likely that many animals, including dogs, navigate using an integration of many of the internal systems and external signals mentioned above. Dogs are also very reward driven – so positive associations with particular places or people are likely to result in a desire to return. The intense olfactory ability of dogs is also likely to assist location awareness – my own dogs appear to ""smell"" the beach miles before we actually see it.', 'Interestingly, recent evidence that dogs and some primates possess a molecule associated with magnetoreception – the ability to sense a magnetic field – might further explain Pero’s return home. Cryptochrome 1 is a light-sensing molecule that regulates circadian rythmns in species as diverse as plants and fish. It seems that this molecule is present in the retinal cone cells of a range of other species too, including dogs, foxes, wolves, bears and badgers. It has also been identified in some primate species including the Bornean orangutan.', ""The reason for the presence of this molecule remains undetermined and researchers have acknowledged that it might not be related to magnetoreception. However, the identification of cryptochrome 1 in the photoreceptors of these mammals' eyes is identical to the location of the same molecule in birds. This might suggest that the ability to respond to magnetic positional information is maintained in birds and some mammals. Indeed, magnetoreception has been documented in different mammal species, leading to the suggestion that dogs might even defecate in response to the earth’s magnetic field."", 'It is interesting to note that researchers have as yet failed to identify this molecule in species such as bats, an animal already known to be capable of navigating using magnetic fields. Perhaps some species have evolved different ways to use magnetic fields to identify location, or, alternatively, a range of interacting biological processes may be involved.', 'It is important to remember however, that Pero and other animals reported as having travelled miraculous distances tend to be the exception rather than the rule. For every amazing story of a pet dog or cat travelling huge distances to return ""home"", there are many more who are quite simply, lost. For those animals, even a deep bond with their human caregiver is not enough to drive or facilitate a long-distance return.', 'So while there does appear to be some fundamental biology that means even our domesticated species can navigate long distances, nailing down the exact science that enabled Pero’s exceptional feat of navigation remains tricky.', 'Jacqueline Boyd, Lecturer in Animal Science, Nottingham Trent University', 'This article was originally published on The Conversation.

The house has been a regular venue for fundraisers for lawmakers from both parties since then.', '""I don\'t remember when I first met Frank, but it was a long time ago,"" Podesta told HuffPost. ""Frank\'s a really go get \'em agent, and he has a good instinct,"" the lobbyist said.', 'Podesta said Snellings\' marriage to Landrieu was ""totally immaterial"" to his decision to list the townhouse with Snellings.', '""We just thought he was a really good real estate agent,"" Podesta said, a compliment borne out by the Examiner story that the townhouse, which was listed earlier this summer for $1.9 million, is under contract with a buyer.', ""The arrangement does not violate Senate ethics rules, and Landrieu is not required to disclose her husband's clients on her Senate financial disclosure forms, although they do disclose that he earns income through real estate. But mixing personal finances with political connections runs the risk that one party or the other could potentially have more than just real estate in mind."", 'Podesta, for instance, counts giant defense contractor Lockheed Martin and oil behemoth BP among his clients. Landrieu, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and comes from a state with a booming oil industry, is undoubtedly a key senator in the eyes of both of these corporations.', ""Podesta assured HuffPost that he never discussed his clients or Landrieu's work with Snellings and that he has never lobbied Landrieu directly on behalf of Lockheed Martin or BP."", 'But the veteran lobbyist rarely misses an opportunity to strengthen his network of powerful friends.', 'At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, he reminded Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) that she had ""a permanent invitation"" to visit the Podestas\' vacation home in Venice, Italy, Mark Leibovich reported in his recent book ""This Town."" The driving force behind the Capitol Hill townhouse sale -- Tony Podesta\'s divorce from fellow super lobbyist Heather Podesta -- may require that invitation to be amended. Regardless, it\'s been previously reported that the Podestas have entertained some 20 members of Congress over the years at their Venice home.', ""Tony Podesta's hiring of Snellings has drawn attention. After the Examiner highlighted the townhouse deal, a slate of other publications in Washington and Louisiana picked up the story."", ""Selling homes on Capitol Hill essentially guarantees that you'll run into a fair share of lobbyists and other power brokers, whether you're married to a senator or not, and Snellings has also represented many clients with no connection to politics. Real estate is a fundamentally word-of-mouth business based on personal networks, so it's not surprising that some of his clients have connections to Landrieu and Louisiana."", 'Landrieu\'s communications director, Matt Lehner, told HuffPost, ""After practicing law in Louisiana for 19 years, Mr. Snellings decided 11 years ago to sell real estate. At that time, he and Sen. Landrieu received guidance from the Senate Ethics Committee that stated it is completely permissible and appropriate for Mr. Snellings to be a real estate agent for anyone. Mr. Snellings and Sen. Landrieu have always abided by the committee\'s rules and guidance, and they disclose their finances every year.""', 'Since Snellings entered the real estate business in 2002, however, he has brokered houses for a number of Louisiana power players, starting with big-time lobbyist John Breaux.

Bobby Jindal (R) and other Louisiana officials."", ""In 2006, Snellings helped Zuschlag buy a house a few blocks from the vice president's mansion. Zuschlag owned the property through a holding company until he retained Snellings again, in 2011, to sell it. In the meantime, the house was occupied by Zuschlag's daughter, Emily Zuschlag and, later, her husband Ross LeBlanc, whom she married in 2008. LeBlanc has his own Landrieu connection: He started out as a scheduling assistant in Landrieu's Senate office, before becoming a research analyst for the Senate Small Business Committee, which Landrieu chairs. LeBlanc and his wife left Washington in 2011."", ""A top lobbyist at Comcast, Melissa Maxfield, hired Snellings to help her buy a house in 2006, three years after she decamped from Capitol Hill to K Street.

"['Wait, You’re Supposed To Wash Your Bras HOW Often?']","['Let’s face it: We can do better when it comes to bras.', 'Whether we’re guilty of wearing the wrong size, going too long between washes or worse ― washing them incorrectly ― there’s a slew of things than can go wrong when it comes to our precious undergarments. ', 'Thanks to the fine folks at Rigby & Peller, we’re feeling a bit more supported when it comes to bra maintenance. The U.K.-based lingerie retailer has over 75 years of experience finding the perfect bras for their customers, and is now helping women in 41 locations worldwide.', 'We chatted with Candece Etafo, Rigby & Peller’s Fifth Avenue boutique manager in New York about all things bras. Herewith, 11 things she wants you to know.', '1. You’re probably not getting measured nearly as often as you should be.', 'If the last time you were measured for a bra involved a Victoria’s Secret employee wrapping a pink measuring tape around you in middle school, it’s definitely time for a check in. Etafo notes that ""A lot can happen, life changes. You could get pregnant, you could gain weight, you could lose weight. So much happens in life that you should check in with your lingerie stylist every six to eight months.""', '2. If your clothing doesn’t fit properly, chances are it has nothing to do with the actual clothing.', 'Having everything in its correct place is crucial not just for supporting what’s underneath, but for making sure everything looks right on the outside, too. Etafo says, ""You need a firm band. A loose band is why your breast tissue is sitting lower when it should be higher. You might say, ‘I know I’m not a size 12, this 10 should fit.’ Once clients come in and get in the right cup size all of a sudden it fits, they can move.""', '3. Tightening your straps when a bra feels loose is far from a cure all.  ', 'We are quick to tighten straps on a bra to make it feel more supportive, but in reality, it’s the band that does all the work. Etafo explains: ""If you needed to put it into numbers, the band is really doing 90 percent of the supporting. It’s important that the band, not the straps, are very firm. ', '4. You’re not washing your bras enough. Period. ', 'When was the last time you washed your favorite bra? A week ago? A month, perhaps? We’re not here to shame you, but we are here to shock you. Etafo says a bra should be washed after every three wears, and those wears should never be in a row. ""You’re stretching them out. Would you do that to your favorite pair of shoes? Your favorite jeans? No."" Just like your clothing, you should rotate your bras.', '5. And you’re probably not washing them correctly, either. ', 'We’re all guilty of throwing our bras in with the rest of our laundry every now and then, but Etafo says that’s a big no-no. ""Ideally we want to hand wash with a lingerie wash. However, I’m a realist, I know we live in a busy city so if you do have to, a lot of new machines have a hand wash cycle or a delicate cycle. You can close the bras and put them inside a wash bag. After they’re washed you want to hang them dry. What’s important about using lingerie wash is that it has ingredients that help your fabric and band bounce back into place. It’s good for anything like your bodysuits, swim, hosiery, etc.""', '6. Straps should *never* dig in to your shoulders ― no matter your bra size.', 'And if they do, Etafo says you ""need shoulder cushions in your life.""', '7. But it’s OK for one cup to be slightly less full than the other.', 'Everyone has one breast that is a bit bigger than the other, and Etafo says even if there is a small gap or space on one side, it won’t show through your clothing. ', '8. Not all bra sizing is created equal.', '""A D is a D, but a DD is the same as an E,"" Etafo says. ""There might be a tiny difference in some retailers, but typically not. In this country we’re used to doing D, DD, DDD but it’s actually D, E, F, G, H, etc. You have a specific cup size, and you should always go by the U.K. sizing so you know the correct one.""', '9. Sleeping in a bra is your choice, but... ', '""The more supported your breast tissue is, the more elevated they will stay,"" Etafo says. She recommends women wear supportive sports bras, if they do choose to sleep in them.', '10. Even if you have enough bras in your wardrobe, chances are you’re not wearing all of them.', 'We all have those bras in our dressers that haven’t been touched in years, and Etafo says it’s time to give those the boot. ""We’ve found that women only wear two out of the 10 bras in their wardrobe. Ideally you want to have between seven and 10 that you wear regularly. That includes a strapless, a sports bra and a convertible.""', '11. Most of all, we need  to take better care of our bras.', 'Wearing the right bra can change your entire look and the way you feel, so why are we still treating them like afterthoughts? ""You have to give that same tender loving care that you do to you clothing as you do to your bras,"" Etafo says.']",1

One such story is what happened aboard a JetBlue flight bound for Orlando.', 'Yesterday, Kelly David Karas, a flight attendant with JetBlue, was part of a crew on a flight that was carrying the grandmother of Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo (known as Omar to his friends and family), one of the victims of the Orlando shooting. Omar’s distraught grandmother was headed to be with family in the aftermath of the tragedy. Kelly and her fellow flight attendant, Melinda, wanted to do something special for Omar’s grandmother to show their support during such a difficult time. So they passed a paper around the plane for the passengers to sign with a note of condolence.', 'But once the paper began circulating, something amazing happened. The passengers wrote pages and pages for Omar’s grandmother, and when the flight was over, every single person aboard the plane stopped to talk to her personally and tell her how sorry they were about her grandson.', 'Kelly was so moved by the incident that she took to Facebook to share what happened aboard the flight, posting a photo of Omar, along with the whole story.', '""Below is a picture of Luis Omar Ocasio-Capo.

Today my dear friend Melinda and I had the sad privilege of attending to his grandmother on our flight as she made her journey to Orlando to join her family during this unspeakable time. Knowing she was making this hard journey alone, JetBlue employees made sure to be at her side every step of the way. Melinda stood quietly by her wheelchair while we waited until it was time to board. Kellie, the gate agent, boarded with her and helped get her settled. Melinda and I gave her a blanket, a pillow, a box of tissues and water so she could be as comfortable as possible. She was understandably distraught, but met us with kindness and gentleness. And gratitude. But here’s where our flight got truly inspiring. I had the idea to pass around a piece of paper to everyone on board and invite them to sign it for this grieving grandmother. I talked it over with Melinda and she started the process from the back of the plane.

When we gathered them together to present them to her, we didn’t have just a sheet of paper covered in names, which is what I had envisioned. Instead, we had page after page after page after page of long messages offering condolences, peace, love and support.

['This one cool trick may eliminate clickbait forever'],"[""Online publishers and advertisers for some time have measured success almost entirely with a single metric: clicks. It’s created a perverse system that rewards publishers and their content producers for goading users into landing on a page with splashy or misleading headlines and content that's attractive and easily digestible, but without much value. Measuring page views = clickbait, in other words."", 'Brian Boyer, the head of National Public Radio’s visuals team, wants to change that online measure of success for news organizations. Boyer and a team of three others were recently awarded a $35,000 grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to come up with a tool that measures the impact of media -- whether it’s a story, slideshow, video or interactive feature -- beyond someone having landed on a webpage. The project, called Carebot, is still in early development -- the project kicks off in February and the team will launch something by April. But the goal is to produce a prototype that measures impact in a more meaningful, substantive way. The Huffington Post spoke with Boyer about the project.', 'Tell me a little bit about the problem you set out to solve. How did the idea first come about?', 'The question that all of us eventually ask ourselves is: Are we doing our jobs, right? Do we have an impact? When I was at ProPublica, at the morning meeting we would shout, ""Impact!"" when Congress passed a bill related to our reporting. But at NPR, our bread and butter isn\'t really accountability journalism; it’s about introducing the audience to people and ideas they\'re not familiar with. So we started thinking about different alternative ways to look at our analytics, and other data we could be gathering that might give us more of a window into if a story made somebody give a shit.', 'At the end of the day, empathy is our impact.', 'How do you measure empathy?', 'My joke about it is we can\'t put our audience in an MRI machine every day, and we don\'t have a window into their souls. So, what can we use as a proxy for those things? A raw page view is just a proxy for: Did we provoke you to click? It\'s not a proxy for if you read it. It\'s not a proxy for if you gave a shit. It\'s a proxy for: Were we successful at provoking you? Google Analytics provides us a ""time on site"" number, but that only roughly allows you to estimate how much time someone spent on a story.', ""The important number we've come up with to measure impact so far is completion rate -- what proportion of people who landed on a page cared enough to read it through? We’re still brainstorming and experimenting with ways to measure how much someone cared about a story. We’re testing the use of buttons at the end of the story that ask the user if they loved the content. We’re looking at the number of shares on social media per page view -- the percentage of readers who were moved to tell their friends about a story. But using page views as the denominator and not the numerator seems like a smart thing to do."", 'How would this make a difference in which stories are celebrated?', 'One of my favorite pieces is a piece we did about the civil war in Yemen.

Something like an analytics dashboard?', ""We're going to have to spend some time designing it, but the general feeling is to be pretty lightweight about the visuals; if there's even anything on the Web, it'll be pretty simple."", 'Instead of having an elaborate analytics dashboard you log into, we’re thinking of a system that is notification-based. It would be along the lines of an email that says, ""Hey, Sarah, your story really killed it in making people care yesterday."" Or I can imagine us writing a Slackbot because the messaging app is the place where the team hangs out. Otherwise, you create a dashboard, people just have to go to it, and it’s always an uphill battle getting people to add anything to their routine. You\'ve got to get in people\'s inboxes.', 'Say the entire industry starts tracking itself in terms of impact rather than clicks. What changes?', 'News organizations are probably more like churches than regular businesses, and NPR is one of the prime examples of an organization that actually acts like a church. We ask people to regularly tithe, and so, for me, if we can create more stories that make people care, then they will, hopefully, become giving members of their local radio station, and it reinforces our business model. We have fewer perverse incentives to write clickbait.', ""Watching The Washington Post staff up their digital organization and then get heavy in the clickbait business, and then celebrate surpassing The New York Times in page views bums me out.

""The thicker the material, the higher the quality,"" Debbie Roes — creator of the Recovering Shopaholic blog — told BuzzFeed.', '2. Do the ""scrunch test"" to see if clothes stay wrinkly.', 'Ball part of the garment up in your fist, hold it for a few seconds, and then let it go. Does the fabric stay wrinkled or do the wrinkles come out quickly? If it can’t stand being wrinkled for a few seconds in your hand, it’s probably not going to withstand the test of time.', '3. Make sure your pattern matches at the seams.', 'Check the side seams of a shirt and around any pockets to instantly tell if quality is high or not. ""Matching a plaid or horizontal stripe may mean using more fabric to cut out the individual pieces of the garment, which can drive up the cost,"" Roes said.', '4. Check out clothing AFTER you try it on.', 'Well-made clothing retains its original shape. Odds are that if it looks misshapen after wearing it for 5 minutes, it’ll only go downhill from there. Before you leave the fitting room, see if any pulls or misshapen areas have started to form so you don’t waste your money.', '5. If you’re shopping for a sheer fabric or lingerie, look for French seams.', 'French seams are a favored seam-finishing technique for designers, Roes explained, since the raw edges of the fabric are hidden in a neat finished seam. French seams are best for fine, thin fabrics that can fray easily, or for lingerie so you don’t have a rough seam against your skin.', '6. Linings are always a *good* sign.', '""Well-made jackets have a taped edge holding lining to the jacket material,"" Roes said.', '7. And lastly: Find something you love with a pen stain on it? Remove it with hairspray when you get home.', 'Spray the pen mark with hairspray and then wipe away with a damp sponge.

But theoretically, what we learn is even more tantalizing. You see, we can extrapolate the Big Bang backwards to an arbitrarily hot, dense, expanding state, and what we find is that it didn't get infinitely hot and dense early on, but rather that   above some energy and before some very early time   there was a phase that preceded the Big Bang, and set it up."", ""That phase, a period of cosmological inflation, describes a phase of the Universe where rather than being full of matter and radiation, the Universe was filled with energy inherent to space itself: a state that causes the Universe to expand at an exponential rate.

So what is the kitty kiss all about anyway? Let’s take a closer examination at this look of love:', '1. You Are Trustworthy', 'If your cat makes a habit of giving you the slow blink, this is an obvious good sign. Cats don’t divvy out their trust to just anyone, so if they are giving you the slow blink then they are doing this to show you that you’ve made it to their inner circle... and that’s a terrific position to be in. Some rescue cats who sadly may have experienced a hard life before you came into the picture may take longer to warm up, but if you continually treat them with love and kindness the kitty kisses should start pouring in. Fun fact: even kittens are tiny masters of the kitty kiss!', '2. You Are A Member Of The Group', 'Got more than just one cat in your home? You may notice your dominant cat showing off his/her kisses when the other cats are around. Your dominant cat is doing this as a signal to the others that all is good, and letting them know there is no need to worry about this human- They are part of our group.

""Usually it takes more than one drink to have any disruptive effects on sleep,"" Roehrs said.', 'Here’s everything you need to know about drinking before bed:', 'Why alcohol is so bad for your sleep', 'Alcohol knocks you out.', 'At first alcohol does make you drowsy, which should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever indulged in a glass of wine at the end of a long day.', 'Studies that compared brain activity in individuals after drinking with brain activity when the same people were sober show that our brains actually ""turn off"" quicker (and subsequently we fall asleep faster) after imbibing. The same sleep-inducing effect happens after drinking during the day, Roehrs said.', 'Unfortunately for our sleep, that’s not the end of the story.', 'As we move through our first cycle of sleep ― and sometimes the second cycle of sleep, depending on how many drinks we’ve had ― alcohol actually suppresses rapid eye movement sleep, Roehrs explained. REM is our lightest stage of sleep, when we dream and when a key part of the learning process happens that makes long-term memories ""stick.""', 'You’ll be tired and irritable the next day.', 'Instead during those first cycles of sleep, we fall (and stay) in the deepest and most restorative stage of sleep: slow wave sleep.', 'This sounds good, but research suggests after drinking, the quality of that deep sleep isn’t quite the same caliber our bodies tend to hit on nights we don’t imbibe ― and this lack of quality is linked to daytime drowsiness, headaches and irritability the next day.', 'You’ll wake up in the middle of the night.', 'What’s more, as our bodies metabolize the alcohol (i.e., as blood alcohol concentration returns to 0), our sleep experiences a rebound effect, Roehrs said. During that second half of the night, our bodies ― in an effort to make up for what was lost earlier in the night ― spend more time in REM sleep.', 'The effect of consolidating sleep in the first half of the night is offset by having more disrupted sleep in the second half of the night. Irshaad Ebrahim, medical director at The London Sleep Centre', 'The problem is REM sleep is when we are most likely to be awakened.', '""The effect of consolidating sleep in the first half of the night is offset by having more disrupted sleep in the second half of the night,"" Irshaad Ebrahim, medical director at The London Sleep Centre, previously said in a statement.', 'In a review of 153 studies that investigated the effect of alcohol on sleep, Ebrahim and his colleagues found alcohol consistently caused an increase in sleep disruption in the second half of a night’s sleep.', 'One study that tracked brain activity in individuals after a night of drinking showed that they woke up roughly twice as often as they did after a night spent without drinking alcohol.', 'How to get smart about drinking before bed', 'How much and whether or not alcohol affects sleep depends on your blood alcohol content when you go to bed, Roehrs explained. His research has shown that a BAC equivalent to about 0.04 is the threshold at which sleep starts to be disrupted.', 'Step 1: Stop after the second round.', 'For an average 150-pound man, it would take about two drinks to raise a BAC to this sleep-disrupting level. And it would probably take closer to a drink and a half for a woman of the same weight to reach the same BAC.', 'Alcohol affects women differently than men, because women have fewer of the gut enzymes that metabolize alcohol than men do. And pound-for-pound, women have less water in their bodies than men do. That means more of the alcohol women drink goes directly into the blood compared with how the same quantity of alcohol would affect men, because in a man more of the alcohol ends up in body water.', 'Step 2: End with a snack', 'Here’s one easy thing you can do to lessen the effect alcohol has on your BAC (and therefor your sleep): Eat something. Food delays how quickly you absorb alcohol, which can help lower your BAC.', 'Step 3: Consider happy hour', 'Timing matters. Adults typically metabolize alcohol at a rate that decreases BAC by about 0.01 to 0.02 per hour. And, in theory, if you drink earlier enough in the evening ― happy hour, anyone? ― your BAC has time to drop below the 0.04 threshold before bed.', 'That means if your BAC is 0.08, it could take as long as four hours once you stop drinking for it to return to 0.04 ― though this depends on things like gender and weight, too.', 'The bottom line: Alcohol will disrupt sleep, but drinking in moderate amounts and long enough before bedtime can still let you snooze easy.']",1

""There’s going to be a disruption.""', 'Roy isn’t happy about this: He believes it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But he also believes the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.', '""Until the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country,"" he told me.', 'This is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that he and his intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.', 'His history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.', '""I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken,"" Roy tells me. ""Trump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.""', 'The conservative movement’s founding error: Barry Goldwater', 'The conservative movement has something of a founding myth — Roy calls it an ""origin story.""', 'In 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckley’s ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, his ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.', 'Normally, Goldwater’s defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, it’s the first act of a tragedy.', '""Goldwater’s nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement,"" Roy tells me, ""because for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.""', '""The gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism""', 'Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He himself was not especially racist — he believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this ""principled"" stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyone’s eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.', 'This had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.', '""The fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans,"" Roy says.

In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was ""popular but indefensible.""', 'This revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their party’s voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.', '""Conservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of a bubble,"" Roy says. ""We’ve had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism — philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.""', 'Conservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isn’t racist.', 'So they deny the party’s racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats’ embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.', '""It’s the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we’ve inherited,"" Roy says.', 'He expands on this idea: ""It’s a common observation on the left, but it’s an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn’t true — which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.""', 'This, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump’s rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwater’s victory was a triumph.', 'But in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trump’s politics of aggrieved white nationalism — labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists — succeeded because the party’s voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.', '""[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement — but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn’t notice,"" Roy concludes, glumly.', 'For conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die', 'Over beers, I ask Roy how he feels about all of this personally. His answer is very sad.', '""When Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life,"" he says.', '""I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work.

Do I do the same things I’ve been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didn’t make a lot of sense.""', 'This soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.', 'Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isn’t a winning formula in a nation that’s increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.', '""Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge, à la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s],"" Roy says.', 'The work of conservative intellectuals today, he argues, is to devise a new conservatism — a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.', '""I think it’s incredibly important to take stock,"" he says, ""and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.""', 'I don’t know how this would work. I don’t think Roy knows either.', 'For the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. That’s Roy’s own diagnosis, and I think it’s correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.', 'I’ve read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.', 'But not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy’s ""cranky old white people"" — and they’re dying off.', 'Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do.

A doctor who decides that those symptoms aren’t caused by something else may prescribe a stimulant to see whether that helps.', 'If you like the feeling of Adderall or Ritalin, you may be less likely to have ADHD.', 'A 2014 study had the surprising finding that people who were genetically predisposed to feel euphoria when on stimulants were also less likely to have genes that predisposed them to ADHD and schizophrenia.', 'This might explain why some people who don’t have ADHD may be especially likely to abuse stimulants – it makes them feel particularly good. Still, that’s probably not the prime factor that drives abuse. A recent study found that the best predictor of stimulant misuse among adolescents was the use of other mind-altering drugs like alcohol, tobacco, or marijuana, which the researchers say indicates there’s a strong social component.

Along with Chinese strategic interests in the South China Sea, the popular pressures on President Xi Jinping to respond are likely to be influenced by the words and actions of the rest of the world.', 'Yes, Chinese people feel strongly about China’s island claims.', 'Nationalist sentiments represent both an opportunity and a challenge for the Chinese government, which wants to harness public opinion but fears its power to destabilize the regime. So far, Beijing has reiterated that the islands in the South China Sea have belonged to China "" since ancient times "" and unequivocally rejected the jurisdiction of the international tribunal. As Chinese censors work to rein in the most extreme online voices calling for war, it remains to be seen whether popular nationalism over the South China Sea will pose a net benefit or liability to the Chinese leadership.', 'The Chinese government’s bluster and patriotic propaganda can be effective at rallying popular support, as I note in a working paper with Allan Dafoe. In two national survey experiments we ran between October 2015 and March 2016, we found that Chinese Internet users or ""netizens"" approved of symbolic expressions of government resolve, even when tough action did not follow tough talk on China’s maritime and territorial disputes. And those netizens who were primed with reminders of China’s ""national humiliation"" by foreign powers between the 1840s and 1940s were also more likely to approve of the government’s current foreign policy performance.', 'But by fanning nationalist sentiment, the Chinese government has also amplified the domestic risks to the regime. In a parallel paper , we find that disapproval of the government increased when netizens were reminded that the United States had sent B-52 bombers through China’s air zone in the East China Sea and defied Chinese warnings against close-in reconnaissance flights, a pattern that escalated with the EP-3 collision and death of a Chinese fighter pilot in April 2001. By rolling out our survey in real time, we found that public approval dipped after each of the U.S. military’s freedom of navigation patrols through the South China Sea on Oct. 27, 2015, and Jan. 30, 2016. These patrols were both innocuous and legitimate to Washington and its allies, but Chinese state media denounced the ""provocative attempts to infringe on China’s South China Sea sovereignty.""', 'In anticipation of the July 12 ruling, the Chinese government and media repeatedly rejected the tribunal’s jurisdiction, perhaps to ease the blow of an adverse ruling. Many of our survey respondents expected a hypothetical arbitration of China’s territorial disputes to favor Beijing, with roughly 60 percent expecting a total or partial victory, 20 percent expecting an even compromise, and 20 percent expecting a partial or total loss. (Perhaps due to this optimism, a majority of respondents supported international arbitration.)', 'How should we interpret Beijing’s signals and actions?', 'Since Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, the Chinese government has been effective at both stoking and quashing nationalist sentiment over the South China Sea, as I note in a recent book on China’s management of anti-foreign protests. The government has fanned patriotic sentiment through the media — but kept it online rather than in the streets.', 'Chinese police intervened when demonstrators tried to protest when the Philippine navy detained Chinese fishing boats in Scarborough Shoal in 2012 , and repressed anti-Vietnamese demonstrations after Vietnamese protests killed several Chinese workers during the 2014 oil rig standoff . Protests by Vietnamese and Filipino activists have prompted Chinese scorn rather than countermeasures, as John Ciorciari and I write in a Security Studies article published last week.', 'The Chinese government is likely to suppress grass-roots expressions of nationalism when it wants freedom to maneuver and to signal reassurance . Police were reportedly stationed outside the Philippine Embassy in Beijing this week, and no protests materialized.', 'On WeChat, a popular social messaging service with more than 600 million users, Chinese state media have stressed that the best response is to ignore the verdict , while insisting that China is prepared to take whatever measures necessary to halt ""any provocation whatsoever"" by the United States and its allies. If we see Chinese protests in the coming days and weeks against the United States or its allies, we should take them seriously as a sign of China’s resolve.', 'Whatever actions the United States and its allies take in the wake of the ruling, a minimum of publicity and a clear legal rationale is likely the most effective course of action. The more we trumpet China’s defeat or loss of face, the more domestic pressure or temptation the Chinese government will feel to respond with more than bluster.']",1

Pasteurization is a process that applies heat to destroy pathogens in food, with the goals of killing disease-carrying germs and preventing milk from going sour too early. During this process, every particle of the fluid is heated to a required temperature then rapidly cooled. Here’s the problem: pasteurization also kills off the beneficial bacteria (probiotics), and even destroys some of the nutritious content in milk, like vitamin C and iodine. It also destroys the enzymes in milk. These lost enzymes make it harder on your body to get calcium and phosphorus out of the cow’s milk.

We have these things called thinking traps, and when we're having a lot of native emotions we tend to catastrophize. We get lost in these thinking traps of beating ourselves up and we begin to have this mental filter where we only see the negative things and ignore the positives. We forget about gratitude."", 'And that kind of leads to the next thing that I think people ignore a lot which is many people have heard of the fight-or-flight response. There\'s a cousin to the fight-or-flight response. It\'s called the tend-and-befriend response, and that is an innate quality of us to reach out to someone for help. We have a hormone even built into us called oxytocin that is expressed, and it\'s telling us ""reach out for help, call a friend, tell someone what\'s going on."" And when we do that, our cortisol levels goes down. We feel better.', 'The third thing that contributes to unhappiness that I see is the way we ignore our body. The way we grow our brain cells, the way we tell our brain to grow is we have to move. We are meant to move, and the second we sit down for more than 20 minutes our body begins to shut down. We are not meant to be still.']",1

"[""How Does 'Overwatch' Hold Up On Consoles?""]","['At times, it feels like Overwatch has been in beta for as long as gamers have known about it.', ""Blizzard clearly wants to make sure its first new IP in more than 15 years knocks it out of the park: not only have select fans been able to test the game out a number of times over the past year, but the Overwatch team has been quick to incorporate and respond to feedback. Long story short, you simply don't see this sort of long-term, hands-on development cycle very often."", 'Then again, that last statement really only applies to the PC side of things. Obviously, Blizzard is making sure that the game is the same across all three platforms, but until the recent open beta, console players never had a chance to play Overwatch. PC players knew that the game would be good going in ... but what about fans with an Xbox One or PlayStation 4?', ""Let's be honest: there's a very good chance that Overwatch will be remembered as a PC game more than anything else. Blizzard is a company that was defined by its library of amazing PC games, and it wasn't until recently that the studio's games even appeared on consoles at all. Thankfully, Overwatch is just as strong on consoles as it is on PC - though fans should expect to see a few differences between the platforms."", ""If you've played Overwatch on more than one platform, then chances are the first thing you noticed were the differences in presentation. With a decently powerful rig, Overwatch looks absolutely gorgeous: effects and explosions are particularly impressive, though the high-res textures and lighting systems deserve mention as well. It may feature a stylized presentation, but that hasn't stopped Blizzard from making yet another stunning game."", ""For the most part, the same could be said of the console versions. Both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One manage to hit the 60 fps benchmark and hold it, only dropping a few frames when explosions and Ultimates start flooding the screen. Even then, the frame drops are small and inconsistent - unless you're looking back through recorded footage, chances are you'll never notice it."", ""The only thing that doesn't seem to hold up is the anti-aliasing: while PC players can choose which settings work best for their system, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions suffer from a bit of aliasing. Again, you won't really notice it if you're not looking for it, though it does stick out as the only notable visual difference."", 'To this day, the debate between using a mouse-and-keyboard versus playing with a controller still rages on. Some will still say that PC hardware provides the most accurate aiming possible, while others prefer the comfort and simplicity provided by a controller.', ""Overwatch fans using a mouse-and-keyboard setup probably won't notice anything out of the ordinary. Overwatch plays like any other FPS out there: point, click and hope that your opponent drops before you do. The control scheme may be different than others in the genre, but the actual mechanics of aiming remain the same."", 'Thankfully, the same could be said when using a controller. While you may have to tweak the sensitivity to your liking, Overwatch still plays beautifully with a pair of analog sticks. It does give the game a slightly different feel, and auto-aim may rub a few people the wrong way, but Blizzard has done a great job of giving console players the same level of control (no pun intended) as PC players.', 'In most console shooters, players are basically locked into a control scheme - Blizzard, on the other hand, has given console users the ability to completely customize their controls. It may sound simple, but the fact that players can set up separate horizontal and vertical look sensitivities is a big deal - and it could go a long way toward making the game that much more accessible for new players.', ""It should come as no surprise that Overwatch is a great game. This is Blizzard we're talking about, a company that's willing to completely cancel a game and scrap years of work before releasing a bad game. On top of that, PC players have known that the game was fun ever since the first beta dropped late last year."", 'However, console players have been burned before.', 'Overwatch has garnered more than a few comparisons to Team Fortress 2, and for good reason. However, while Team Fortress 2 is still a staple of PC gaming, the sub-par console version died a quick, painful death. There are plenty of players who worry that the same would happen to Overwatch.', ""While it's still too early to tell what the future holds for Blizzard's new shooter, console fans can rest assured that the game is definitely worth playing on their platform of choice. Overwatch may be known as a PC-centric title now, but we wouldn't be surprised if a dedicated console community popped up, too."", ""For the time being, we'll just have to wait and see: Overwatch is set for release on May 24."", '© 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration estimates that motorcycle helmets reduce the likelihood of a crash fatality by 37 percent, but only 19 states require their use.

But equally as important is the need for culture to change—and the same principle can be applied to action sports.', '""There’s evolution within sports,"" says Chris McNamara. ""It starts out a little more risky until, collectively, everyone decides that it just won’t be that risky. There was a point in time when you were an idiot if you wore a helmet on the ski slopes.

['Does Marijuana Make You Stupid?'],"['Marijuana is currently regulated by the United States government as a Schedule I drug, placing it in the same category as heroin, MDMA and LSD. This is largely due to the first condition of Schedule I drugs, which is that the substance ""has a high potential for abuse."" The language in that clause is deliberately vague. Does abuse equal addiction? Probably not, since marijuana is not addictive like other Schedule I drugs. Rats don’t self-administer the compound in a lab, it’s virtually impossible to fatally overdose on the drug, and the physiological effects of marijuana withdrawal, if they occur, are far milder than those experienced by chronic amphetamine, alcohol, nicotine or opiate users. Put another way, if ""abuse"" means ""addiction"" then cigarettes should be Schedule I, not marijuana.', 'Rather, the case for marijuana ""abuse"" has always stemmed from its cognitive effects. While cigarettes are like caffeinated smoke — they increase attention and productivity, marijuana is the drug of choice for slackers, hippies and Seth Rogen characters. In popular culture, all it takes is one hit from a bong before people become ridiculously dumb, unable to solve the simplest problems or utter a coherent sentence. Potheads eat a lot and laugh at stupid jokes. The larger worry, of course, is that such damage is enduring and that ""smoking dope"" permanently impedes learning and memory.', 'That, at least, has been the collective stereotype for decades. There’s even been some science to back it up, especially when the marijuana use begins at an early age. But now a different answer is beginning to emerge, thanks to an authoritative new study led by Robert Tait at the Australian National University. The scientists looked at the long-term cognitive effects of marijuana use in nearly 2,000 subjects between the ages of 20 and 24. The subjects were divided (based on self-reports) into several different categories, from total abstainers (n = 420) to ""current light users"" (n = 71) to ""former heavy users"" (n = 60). Over the course of eight years, the scientists gave the subjects a battery of standard cognitive tests, most of which focused on working memory, verbal memory and intelligence. One of the important advantages of this study is that the scientists controlled for a number of relevant variables, such as education and gender. In Time, Maia Szalavitz explains why this statistical adjustment is necessary:', 'The lower education levels of the pot smokers — and their greater likelihood of being male — had made it look like marijuana had significantly affected their intelligence. In fact, men simply tend to do worse than women on tests of verbal intelligence, while women generally underperform on math tests. The relative weighting of the tests made the impact of pot look worse than it was.', 'Once these population differences were corrected for, the long-term effects of marijuana use disappeared: The scientists found that ""there were no significant between group differences."" In other words, the amount of pot consumed had no measurable impact on cognitive performance. The sole exception was performance on a test of short-term verbal memory, in which ""current heavy users"" performed slightly worse than former users. The researchers conclude that, contrary to earlier findings, the mind altering properties of marijuana are ephemeral and fleeting:', 'The adverse impacts of cannabis use on cognitive functions either appear to be related to pre-existing factors or are reversible in this community cohort even after potentially extended periods of use. These findings may be useful in motivating individuals to lower cannabis use, even after an extensive history of heavy intake.', 'This study builds on previous work by Harvard researchers demonstrating that the learning and memory impairments of heavy marijuana users typically vanish within 28 days of ""smoking cessation."" (The slight impairments still existed, however, one week after smoking.) While several days might sound like a long hippocampal hangover, heavy alcohol users typically experience deficits that persist for several months, if not years. In other words, heavy marijuana use appears to be a lot less damaging than alcoholism.', 'Taken together, these studies demonstrate that popular stereotypes of marijuana users are unfair and untrue. While it’s definitely not a good idea to perform a cognitively demanding task (such as driving!) while stoned, smoking a joint probably also won’t lead to any measurable long-term deficits. The Dude, in other words, wasn’t dumb because he inhaled. He was dumb because he was The Dude. (All those White Russians probably didn’t help, either.)', 'Furthermore, there’s some intriguing evidence that marijuana can actually improve performance on some mental tests. A recent paper by scientists at University College, London looked at a phenomenon called semantic priming. This occurs when the activation of one word allows us to react more quickly to related words. For instance, the word ""dog"" might lead to decreased reaction times for ""cat,"" ""pet"" and ""Lassie,"" but won’t alter how quickly we react to ""chair.""', 'Interestingly, the scientists found that marijuana seems to induce a state of hyper-priming, in which the reach of semantic priming extends to distantly related concepts. As a result, we hear ""dog"" and think of nouns that, in more sober circumstances, would seem rather disconnected, such as ""leash"" or ""hair."" This state of hyper-priming helps explain why cannabis has been so often used as a creative fuel, as it seems to make the brain better at detecting those remote associations that lead to radically new ideas.', 'Why does marijuana increase access to far reaching intellectual connections? One possibility is that the beneficial effect of the drug is mediated by mood. Marijuana, after all, has long been used to quiet anxious nerves — big pharma is currently exploring targeted versions of THC as a next generation anxiolytic — as only a few puffs seem to dramatically increase feelings of relaxation and euphoria. (The technical term for this, of course, is getting stoned.) Furthermore, recent research has suggested that performance on various tests of remote associations and divergent thinking — a hallmark of creativity — are dramatically enhanced by such positive moods. Look, for instance, at a 2003 study by German researchers that investigated performance on a classic remote associate test (RAT), in which subjects have to find a fourth word that is associated with the three following words:', 'cottage Swiss cake', 'This answer is pretty obvious: cheese. But what about this problem?', 'dream ball book', 'That was a trick question: There is no shared association. Here’s the remarkable thing about these remote associate problems: People can recognize the possibility of a solution before they’ve solved the problem. The German scientists demonstrated this by asking people to quickly press the spacebar whenever they were presented with a triad that had an answer. If people had no intuitions about creative associations, their guesses should have been roughly random. But that’s not what the scientists found. Instead, subjects were able to efficiently sort ""coherent"" word problems — those with an actual answer — from incoherent problems, which are a waste of time. Before we find the solution, we can feel its presence.', 'And this returns us to marijuana: Putting people in a positive mood roughly doubled their accuracy at the task. All of a sudden, they were twice as good at identifying problems with possible solutions. This suggests that anything that makes us happier, reducing vigilance and anxiety, might also make us more creative. We can detect more remote associations, of course, but we also know which associations are worth pursuing, which is probably even more important. It doesn’t matter if it’s pot, chocolate or a stand-up comic — those substances or experiences that put a smile on our face can also increase the powers of the imagination, at least when solving particular creative problems.', 'So here’s the very un-D.A.R.E. takeaway: Heavy marijuana use doesn’t seem to cause any sort of lasting brain damage. All the negative side-effects are relatively temporary. (But those side-effects are real.) Furthermore, the sort of anxiolytic giddiness triggered by THC comes with its own unexpected benefits, which is probably why humans have been self-medicating with cannabis for thousands of years.']",1

A daunting task even as the kids get older and the lists get shorter. Gone in my house are the days when the most expensive item on the list was the ever-elusive ""just this size"" binder. Now, we’re talking calculators that rival my electricity bill. But I sigh, watch the ads, and get out there and do it. I put on my thickest armor because nothing will be just right for my kids. The kitty folders are too childish; the more mature ones are $200 a piece. Add to that the hysterical mobs crowding the $1 pencils like they were the last chance to win tickets to a 21 Pilots concert, and we have a joyfest that keeps on giving.

We should all be interested in what will create the best learning environment for all these kids, for all these little people who will be making big decisions some day like what to do with YOUR Social Security or how to fix YOUR city infrastructure or how best to treat that cancerous mass in YOUR body.', 'If you don’t agree with something on the list and think it’s excessive, have a conversation with the teacher. I guarantee if it is something that will actually get used to educate your children , the teacher will be able to explain how. Yes, Expo markers are expensive. Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo.

The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren’t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens? Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid’s teacher’s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by – how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let’s see. Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it’s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn’t that extra $10 a little worth it?', 'I’m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we’re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers. Umm, let’s back up a minute. Aren’t they the ones doing us the favor? I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can’t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don’t learn as well then. I’m frustrated that we can’t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones. Be frustrated with me for the right reasons.']",1

['This Is What Happens To Your Body When You Eat Too Much Salt'],"['While salt is an important factor in many of your body’s functions, and, through chemistry, makes your food taste better, it’s common knowledge that too much salt in your diet can lead to a host of problems. Many know this to be true, but don’t know exactly what problems salt leads to.', 'So in an effort to demonstrate just how bad salt-packed foods can be for our bodies, let’s take a look at what salt does to your body when consumed in excess of the recommended daily allowance.', '1. First of all, salt makes your body hold more water than it normally would. That’s why you’ll often find your fingers bloated and swollen after a particularly salty meal. This is because our kidneys likes to keep the ratio of certain electrolytes, like salt, in proportion to the amount of water we have in our bodies. If that ratio skews salt-heavy, then our body compensates by carrying more water to keep things proportionate.', 'The swelling mentioned above can become semi-permanent (called edema), and more blood will flow through your body, which can cause your circulatory system to stiffen, putting you at higher risk for high blood pressure and hypertension.', '2. Because you’re holding processing more water than normal, you tend to urinate more, which can not only make you dehydrated if not replaced, but can also serve to flush out calcium, which your body relies on for skeletal strength. As calcium levels fall, you can run a higher risk of osteoporosis or even tooth decay.', '3. Increased salt consumption can also, for reasons that still aren’t entirely clear to scientists, cause irritation in the stomach, resulting in ulcers, and raising the risk of stomach cancer. Sodium can have a powerfully conducive effect with many chemical reactions, and with a stomach full of acid and food, a disruption in the equilibrium can have serious effects.', 'The recommended daily allowance of salt is 2,300 milligrams per day, but many diets far exceed that, especially those that are high in processed or fast food. This week, New York City enacts a law that requires restaurants to denote any single dish that exceeds that threshold.', 'So while you may need to reduce the amount of salt that you consume, the first thing you need to do is to be aware of how much salt you consume, and a little diligence, along with laws like the one that New York City passed, will help you do just that.']",1

['Scientists may have found humankind’s original addiction'],"[""In studying how ultraviolet radiation affects skin, scientists may have stumbled across humankind's original addiction: sunlight."", 'A new study in the journal Cell shows that UV radiation, even in modest amounts, prompts production of the ""feel-good"" hormone beta-endorphin that numbs mice to pain. When scientists blocked beta-endorphin with the drug Naloxone (used to combat heroin overdoses in hospital emergency rooms), UV-exposed mice experienced withdrawal symptoms: shaking, teeth-chattering and jumpiness.', ""It's the first time scientists have thoroughly mapped out the pathway in mice from UV exposure, to rising beta-endorphin levels in the blood, to physical dependence on sunlight. The findings add to a field of research that examines extreme tanning as a possible addiction in humans, and could explain why people love to sunbathe -- even though it's clear that UV rays damage skin cells, age skin prematurely and cause skin cancer."", ""In addition, the findings could pave the way for more research on battling opiate addiction in general, since beta-endorphins are opioids -- our body's own natural version of opiate-like drugs."", '""The concept that we would have a pathway in our skin that is organically guiding us to to seek out the most common carcinogen in the world almost seems like a joke,"" said senior study author Dr. David Fisher, chairman of the dermatology department at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School. ""From a scientific perspective, this raises an interesting prospect that perhaps UV-seeking was the original addiction.""', ""While it wasn't the focus of the research, Fisher and his team speculate that vitamin D synthesis is the evolutionary reason human beings seek the sun. Vitamin D is vital to calcium absorption and bone health, and when you're a child, lack of vitamin D can be fatal."", '""It\'s plausible that a behavioral motivation to seek the sun to preserve vitamin D may have produced many years ago, say 100,000 years ago, as an evolutionary advantage,"" Fisher said. Now, of course, physicians recommend people take vitamin D supplements to guard against deficiencies.', ""THE 'FEEL-GOOD' HORMONE"", ""The study started off with exposing shaved mice to UV rays for six weeks. Then, in a series of experiments, Fisher and other researchers measured the rodents' blood levels of beta-endorphins, tested their pain thresholds and injected them with Naloxone."", 'They found that beta-endorphin levels increased significantly in UV-exposed mice, and that these mice had a much higher pain threshold than non-UV-exposed mice (echoing the numbing effects of opiate drugs like heroin and morphine in humans). Also, injecting UV-exposed mice with the overdose drug Naloxone seemed to induce withdrawal symptoms, suggesting they had become physically dependent on UV rays.', ""To test if the UV rays would alter the rodents' behavior, Fisher placed the UV-exposed mice in two cages connected by a tunnel, one dark and one brightly lit. Researchers wanted to see if the mice, which are nocturnal, would go against their habits to run to the lit cage if they had been exposed to UV rays."", 'Researchers induced withdrawal symptoms in the mice using Naloxone while they were trapped in the dark cage. The next day, the UV-exposed mice went against their nocturnal nature and crossed over to the lit cages, because they associated the dark cages with something they wanted to avoid.', 'The important thing to note in all this is that the mice were exposed to UV rays meant to approximate ""midday sun exposure in Florida during the summer for [a] fair-skinned person of average tanning ability"" -- in other words, a fairly moderate, normal amount of sun for many North Americans. That was deliberate, because researchers didn\'t want to use a dose that would lead to sunburn or inflammation. ""We wanted it to be as much about UV radiation as possible, and not a second consequence of injury to skin,"" Fisher said.', ""TREATING TANNING 'ADDICTS'"", ""Dr. Robin Hornung, a dermatologist and skin cancer expert in Everett, Washington, praised the methodology of Fisher's study, and said the findings echo what she sees in her everyday practice: patients who seem to be addicted to tanning."", 'Understanding how tanning may be an addiction could help more doctors understand that facts alone may not be enough to get patients to quit sunning, Hornung said. Instead, it could be better for doctors to approach tanners similarly to how they approach smokers: by tailoring the approach based on whether patients are contemplating, preparing, or taking action to change behavior. Push them too hard, and doctors might end up alienating their patients.', '""I have known patients who have left their dermatologist for another doctor as they felt criticized about their addiction,"" Hornung wrote. ""It is important to establish good rapport and trust with the patient, not to chastise and alienate, and to ultimately take a more comprehensive approach to changing their behavior.""', 'Dr. Bryon Adinoff, chief of the Division on Addictions at the UT Southwestern Medical Center and Director of Mental Health Research at the VA North Texas Health Care System, said the new findings are ""relatively conclusive that UVR [UV radiation] increases endorphin in rodent models."" However, he cautioned against using the word ""addiction"" to describe tanning, as research has yet to demonstrate UV addiction biologically.', '""Their approach shows a mechanism about how UVR could become addictive, but it did not demonstrate that it did become addictive,"" Adinoff told HuffPost. ""They demonstrated it induces physiological dependence, but anyone taking opioids for a few days, whether its for chronic pain or acute injury, is going to develop some physiological dependence.""', 'And physiological dependence is not necessarily addiction. Adinoff\'s past UV studies showed that the rays could activate reward regions in the brain, similar to the way any other pleasurable stimuli would activate those regions. But that\'s different than being addicted, he explained: ""People who go to tanning salons or the beach don\'t necessarily become addicts, just like how people can drink alcohol and not become addicted.""']",1

"['The hit song that lost this band $100,000  via @YahooMusic']","['New Order’s 1983 synth classic ""Blue Monday"" is one of the most important and beloved songs of the new wave era. The nine-minute alt-dance opus influenced and inspired everyone from the Eurythmics’ Dave to electronic music pioneers Kraftwerk, and to this day it holds the record as the top-selling 12-inch single in recording history, shifting more than a million units in the band’s native U.K. alone. So how exactly did ""Blue Monday"" manage to not only make no profit, but also actually lose a whopping $100,000?', 'The Manchester group’s iconic founding bassist, Peter ""Hooky"" Hook, explains that it all came down to indie label Factory Records’ decision regarding the single’s very famous — but very expensive — packaging.', '""[Graphic designer] Peter [Saville] came to the practice place, and he saw a floppy disk and he loved it,"" Hook recalls, as he sits with Yahoo Music reflecting on his illustrious discography with both New Order and the band from which New Order sprang, the equally influential Joy Division. ""And he felt we should do the sleeve [to look] like this ... Unbeknownst to him, it had to be die-cut three times, which made the sleeve ridiculously expensive — which [New Order bandmate] Stephen Morris thought was hilarious, because you were paying for the bits that you didn’t get, the hole, where the card had gone!', '""But yeah, the sleeve unfortunately cost 10p [approximately 20 cents] more than the record could earn, so every time we sold a copy of ‘Blue Monday,’ we were losing 10p,"" Hook elaborates with a rueful chuckle: ""It then went on to be the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time! I remember [Factory Records label head] Tony [Wilson] going to great trouble to cast a brass Factory symbol that said, ‘Well Done, Hooky!’ celebrating a loss of 50,000 pounds ... I suppose it really seals its place in history as a mythical being for that reason.""', 'The financial failure of what should have been New Order’s commercial career breakthrough was just one in a long line of both comedic and tragic errors for the beleaguered band. The most tragic of all, of course, transpired when the band was known as the legendary post-punk outfit Joy Division, fronted by the charismatic but deeply troubled Ian Curtis. Struggling with the dissolution of his young marriage, new fatherhood, an extramarital emotional affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honoré, and most of all, his increasingly uncontrollable epilepsy, 23-year-old Curtis committed suicide on the eve of what was supposed to be Joy Division’s first North American tour — leaving his guilt-ridden bandmates behind to pick up the pieces and always wonder what might have been.', '""With the making of [Joy Division’s sophomore album] Closer, Ian’s illness was degenerative, and it was getting worse,"" says Hook. ""The big problem with Ian was ... he was very empathic to other people. He would go out of his way to make sure you felt all right about what he was suffering ... Ian worked very, very hard and was still suffering grand mals right the way through [the recording sessions for Closer]. He managed to hide it from his parents, from the doctors that he was being treated by. The guy wanted success. He wanted to achieve what he felt we deserved. And he hid [his epilepsy]. That was the problem. He would never let you know how poorly he was, so you were in ignorance. Even when you were picking him up off the floor when he smashed his head open on the sink or the toilet, he’d just get up. He’d never stop.', '""Suicide of a very close friend or family member always leaves you with the guilt,"" Hook continues solemnly. ""And that’s the beauty of suicide, isn’t it? It’s not them worrying afterwards. It’s everybody else saying who, when, or why, or ‘Did I do enough?’ I’ve had enough of that in my life to realize that people who are left behind are the ones that suffer. But it was a great LP, and I think one of my greatest regrets when we finished with Joy Division and moved on to New Order was that we never got to play Closer ... It was heartbreaking to put it all away and never promote Closer, never promote [the single] ‘Love Will Tear Us Apart,’ put it in a box, put it in the back of the cupboard. And we went off to New Order.""', 'Incredibly, the surviving members of Joy Division immediately decided to reform as New Order. (""I think the great thing about being young is you can carry on, regardless. The great thing about being a musician is people will coddle you and pamper you, and pander to you, so we didn’t have to do much grieving. We just buried our heads and stuck together and ignored it, basically."") Reconvening in their Salford rehearsal space the Monday after Curtis’s inquest, they went right to work on a prophetically titled new song Hook had written over the weekend in tribute to Curtis, ""Dreams Never End.""', 'But while New Order — pesky 50,000-pound loss aside — went on to greater success than the short-lived Joy Division had ever known, all was not dreamy in their world. At first, Joy Division fans were still in mourning, and they weren’t quick to accept this new phase in the band’s career. (""We got a lot of letters written in blood, things like that. People phoning you up. Being a ‘man of the people,’ I put my number in the phone book, and then I had every Joy Division loony phoning me up and being weird on the phone. That taught me a lesson,"" says Hook.) Then, when New Order went to America to play the tour that had been originally booked for Joy Division, ""fans weren’t supportive. They used to spend the whole gig shouting for Joy Division titles,"" Hook recalls. ""I didn’t expect them to be supportive, to be honest ... we actually lost a lot of our confidence ... the audiences were openly hostile. They wanted Joy Division.""', 'To make matters worse, on the very first night of New Order’s maiden U.S. tour, all of their gear was stolen from their van. ""And it wasn’t insured!"" exclaims Hook. ""In the space of two months, we’d managed to lose our lead singer [Curtis], our group [Joy Division], and our equipment ... It really was being at the bottom of a very long ladder. It was a hell of an education, that trip to America.""', 'New Order went on to moderate American success with perennial alternative radio staples like ""Bizarre Love Triangle,"" ""True Faith,"" ""Shellshock"" (which was included on the Pretty in Pink soundtrack), and a 1988 re-release of ""Blue Monday."" But over the years, friction between Hook and lead singer Bernard Sumner continued to grow, and in 2007, Hook left the band for good. Fans may hold out hope for a real New Order reunion (the band continues to tour and record sans Hook), but according to the grizzled bassist, who’s been battling his ex-bandmates in court for years, those fans probably shouldn’t hold their breath.', '""Literally, [we’re] at that point in the relationship where you hate each other’s stinking guts,"" he reveals. ""It’s a tragic end to a wonderful, wonderful group. You know, I long for Tony Wilson [who passed away in 2007] to appear and bang our heads together. For [late former band manager] Rob Gretton to appear and bang our heads together. For Ian Curtis to appear and bang our heads together! I really do wish with all my heart that we could stop and just respect each other. I think that’s what we should be working on.""', 'Says Hook: ""We shouldn’t be working on getting one over each other. We should be sitting down and going, ‘Listen, we’re all different people, we all share this same heritage, and it’s important to all of us. So what we should do is share it, learn to live together, learn to show respect, because we created it together.’ Whether you like it or not, that’s the truth — it’s all of ours. You can’t take it off one person, and you can’t say one person’s wrong and shouldn’t have it. Because we should all have it. And until somebody wises up and says, ‘What are you doing?’ and that respect is shown, and you can’t even contemplate anything else.""', 'While a Hook-less New Order carries on, Hook is still out there on his own. He has penned three memoirs (including his juicy, 724-page latest, Substance: Inside New Order), and he regularly revisits the Joy Division and New Order discographies on tour with his band the Light, showcasing his distinctive bass style (which once even attracted the attention of the Rolling Stones, when they were looking to hire a replacement for Bill Wyman).', '""The great bit for me is that in 2011, I got to play Closer [in its entirety for the first time], and it was one of the most beautiful moments of my life,"" Hooks says happily. ""To sit there and have my son, who was exactly the same age I was when I did Closer [22 years old], playing the basslines, and me doing my best to do Ian justice ... the chills down your spine from hearing Closer live was a wonderful, wonderful moment. I do think really Barney [Sumner] and Steve [Morris] missed out on that.""', 'And as for what might have happened if Curtis hadn’t killed himself, Hook confesses that he wonders about that sometimes. ""Do I think we’d still be together if Ian had lived? I would hope so,"" he muses. ""You know, one of the things about a song like ‘Blue Monday’ being as popular as it is, even now throughout the world, is that you’d have loved to hear Ian Curtis sing on it.', '""But the important thing you realize, as you get older, is that the fact that [Joy Division] didn’t carry on wasn’t the most important thing for Ian. The most important thing was a daughter lost her father. Parents lost a son. A wife lost a husband. A lover lost a lover. That is really the important thing — because let’s face it, there’s lots of groups. There’ll be another along in a minute.""']",1

['Is feminism killing romance?'],"['Ever wondered what it would be like to date in a completely gender-equal world? The answer may surprise you', 'Heterosexual romantic relationships have historically been all about men courting and ""keeping"" women. And it’s a powerful tradition. Whether it’s asking someone out, picking up the bill, or being the main breadwinner in the family, many of the ideas we have about romance are still based on men being initiators and directors and women being receivers and caretakers. Yet society is changing. Women are increasingly entering the ""male domains"" of high-powered jobs and sexual freedom.', 'So how does all this affect romance? Given that popular (mis)conceptions of feminism tend to malign feminists as man-haters or lesbians, it’s easy to see why many people view gender equality as incompatible with romance, and a hindrance to romantic relationships. But is this really the case? Let’s take a look at the evidence.', 'Traditionally, women’s main route to status and influence involved attracting high-status romantic partners. But while the movement for gender equality has changed things, cultural scripts about romance have curtailed women’s social roles and still continue to do so.', 'For example, when adolescent girls describe their first sexual experience, they frequently refer to it as something that just ""happened to them"", whereas boys’ accounts don’t show this lack of agency. This power imbalance also occurs in adults, with men being more likely to initiate and lead sex than women.', 'Yet, researchers have also noticed that heterosexual scripts of romance are becoming more egalitarian over time. Spurred by the movement for equality, women are increasingly adopting active roles in initiating romance and are displaying more dominant sexual behaviours.', 'For women, the pay-off is obvious. Traditional cultural views of romance thwart women’s ability to express themselves, as it requires a relinquishing of control and agency. We know this leads to dissatisfaction with sex and relationships. Conversely, greater agency and equality in a relationship has been associated with better communication, improved relationship satisfaction and a better sex life. One study found that women in relationships with feminist men reported healthier relationships – both in terms of quality and long-term stability – than those in relationships with non-feminist men.', 'More generally, conforming to traditional romantic ideas may also limit women’s willingness and ability to seek equality. One study found that women who associate their romantic partners with chivalry and being a ""protector"" – as in the ideal of a Prince Charming – were less interested in pursuing higher education and higher-status occupations.', 'Are men suffering?', 'Many men seem to believe that gender equality will cause relationship problems. But is this the case? One way of approaching this issue is to look at what happens when couples shift away from traditional family roles, with men taking on more responsibility in the home. Studies of couples who live together suggest that greater equality in earning income and sharing of household chores is associated with greater relationship stability and having sex more often.', 'Indeed, when husbands take on a greater role in housework, shopping and childcare, it seems to result in lower divorce rates. Likewise, when fathers take paternity leave and contribute more to homecare, it results in greater marital stability.', 'More broadly, one study showed that men who said they were in relationships with feminist women reported greater relationship stability and sexual satisfaction. The authors of this study concluded that, far from disrupting heterosexual relationships, greater gender equality in a relationship was healthy – for both women and men. Other research has also suggested that men who eschew traditional cultural scripts of romance tend to have more satisfying and committed relationships.', 'There’s also a darker side to traditional relationships. The dominant role for men in relationships is problematic for wider society because it can socialise men into a culture of violence. Research consistently shows that men who more strongly endorse traditional gender roles, including in relationships, are more likely to report a history of sexually coercive behaviours, are more likely to blame the victims of rape and are more accepting of intimate partner violence.', 'Performing gender', 'But why does equality make us happy? One reason might be that endorsement of traditional cultural scripts of romance places a heavy burden on men, just as it does on women. Having to ""perform"" according to traditional scripts limits expressions of individuality and behaviours – ultimately making it harder for two people to develop true intimacy. In fact, men are increasingly expressing frustration at relationships that force them to follow the male-initiator cultural script for precisely this reason.', 'It even applies to the bedroom, where it can reduce spontaneity and lower sexual satisfaction. In fact, when it comes to sex, there is evidence that both women and men experience greater sexual satisfaction when the woman doens’t feel that she has to be submissive (unless of course that’s a personal preference).', 'Another reason why greater gender equality may lead to more stable relationships is because it promotes more positive communication patterns. Gender equality facilitates a sharing of responsibility to resolve conflicts (as opposed to placing that burden primarily on women) and may lead to more expressive communication styles which benefit the relationship.', 'So does that mean that men should stop initiating romantic relationships or that women should start picking up the bill? In the short term (on a first date for example), conforming to cultural scripts may facilitate interactions, so long as both partners are on the same page. But in the longer-term, perpetuating gendered inequalities in our romantic relationships will likely cause more harm than good. Gender equality in relationships doesn’t mean that we lose the romance. If anything, it lays the basis for more satisfying and healthier relationships.']",1

Whereas medicine these days is usually contained in pills or effervescent tablets, Vicks treats your ailments with vapors.

The product also works as a good topical analgesic for other issues.', 'All of this is fairly common knowledge, but did you know about Vicks’ other useful properties? There are plenty of home remedies out there for different kinds of issues that involve the fresh, strong-smelling ointment. Here are a few of them:', '1. Headaches', 'For standard headaches, AnswersVideo (in the video below) suggests applying some Vicks to your temples for quick pain relief. If you’re suffering from a sinus headache instead, Livestrong recommends putting ointment under your nose and breathing in slowly and deeply.', '2. Muscle aches', 'Massage Vicks over the muscles that are causing pain, then wrap them in a dry, warm towel for a while, according to LiveStrong.', '3. Soothe earaches', 'An earache can be a symptom of an ear infection, but it can also be an effect of a common cold, states WebMD. Even while following doctor-recommended care to fight the cause, the pain can make daily activities difficult, particularly going to sleep. Home Remedies for Life lists a cotton ball with Vicks VapoRub as a simple home remedy to ease the pain. Simply rub a little on a cotton ball and place it in the ear all night or until the pain has subsided.', '4. Toenail fungus', 'Infected toenails should be rubbed with VapoRub two to three times a day for as long as is needed, eHow reports. The process may take several weeks to months.', '5. Cracked heels', 'Apply Vicks to the heels and balls of your feet, then massage it into the damaged areas. Do this in the evening, then sleep with socks on. The next morning, rinse the product off with warm water and exfoliate with a pumice stone, Livestrong suggests.', '6. Repel bugs', 'AnswersVideo suggests applying light amounts of Vicks to clothing and skin to scare bugs away. If you get bitten anyway, try rubbing some ointment on that spot for itch relief.', '7. Keep animals at bay', 'Cats will stay away from furniture dabbed with Vicks, helping you keep your couch, doors and curtains scratch-free.', '8. Heal bruises and minor cuts', 'Apply a thin layer of Vicks and salt to bruises. The combination will help your blood circulate faster and dissolve the bruise mark in shorter amounts of time, according to Livestrong. AnswersVideo also suggests rubbing the ointment around small cuts to improve healing. However, eHow warns against applying the product to open wounds and damaged skin, so be careful with this one.', '9.

Maybe some big road trips are on your retirement bucket list, or you need a car to visit your far flung kids.

Indeed, the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, which runs a national Eldercare Locator, reports the number one reason people call that line is they need help finding transportation.

To those of us who speak English as our first tongue, these nonsensical grammar conventions come as second nature. Some rules are so innate that they rarely get taught in school.', 'Take this example recently spotted by Quartz', 'This passage tweeted by BBC editor Matthew Anderson comes from the book The Elements of Eloquence: How to Turn the Perfect English Phrase. It outlines the rules of adjective order when preceding a noun. According to the text, the order goes ""opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose Noun"" and any change made to that organization will make you ""sound like a maniac.""

['Why You Shouldn’t Wrap Your Food In Aluminum Foil Before Cooking It'],"['If you’re baking fish, roasting vegetables or preparing a piece of meat for dinner tonight, chances are that you’ll wrap your food in aluminium foil. What you may not realise is that some of the foil will leach into your meal – and this could be bad for your health.', 'Research that I conducted with a group of colleagues has explored the use of aluminium for cooking and preparing food. Aluminium doesn’t just appear in foil: it is the most popular cookware material used by people in developing countries. Pots and pans are lined with it and it is found in some kitchen utensils like large serving spoons. Copper used to fulfil this role, but over time it’s been replaced by aluminium because it is cheaper to mass produce and easier to clean.', 'But while cooking your food in aluminium pots or pans isn’t a bad thing, placing it in foil and putting it in the oven is problematic. This is especially true with acidic or spicy food that’s prepared at high temperatures.', 'Aluminium and health', 'Human bodies can excrete small amounts of aluminium very efficiently. This means that minimal exposure to aluminium is not a problem: the World Health Organisation has established a safe daily intake of 40mg per kilogram of body weight per day. So for a person who weighs 60kg the allowable intake would be 2400 mg.', 'But most people are exposed to and ingest far more than this suggested safe daily intake. Aluminium is present in corn, yellow cheese, salt, herbs, spices and tea. It’s used in cooking utensils, as described above, as well as in pharmacological agents like antacids and antiperspirants. Aluminium sulfate, which is derived from aluminium, is used as a coagulant during the purification process of drinking water.', 'Scientists are exploring whether over-exposure to aluminium may be posing threats to human health. For instance, high concentrations of aluminium have been detected in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists have examined the community of old people with Alzheimer’s and concluded that it is a modern disease that’s developed from altered living conditions associated with society’s industrialisation. These conditions may include high levels of aluminium in daily life.', 'Aluminium poses other health risks, too. Studies have suggested that high aluminium intake may be harmful to some patients with bone diseases or renal impairment. It also reduces the growth rate of human brain cells.', 'Avoid foil when cooking', 'Given all of these proven risks, it’s important to determine the aluminium concentration when cooking. Pots and other cookware tend to be oxidised, providing an inert layer that prevents the aluminium from leaching into food. The problem is that when you scrub your pots after cooking, that layer is worn away and the aluminium can seep into your food. This is easily avoided: when you get new aluminium pots, boil water in them several times until the base becomes matt. This creates a natural oxidation that prevents leaching. They may look nicer when they’re scrubbed and shiny, but a matt base is better for your food and your health.', 'But cooking your food in foil is a different story. Aluminium foil is disposable and you will not be able to create that inert layer prior to using it. My research found that the migration of aluminium into food during the cooking process of food wrapped in aluminium foil is above the permissible limit set by the World Health Organisation.', 'Ghada Bassioni explains the research she and her colleagues conducted.', 'Aluminium is significantly more likely to leach into food, and at higher levels, in acidic and liquid food solutions like lemon and tomato juice than in those containing alcohol or salt. Leaching levels climb even more when spice is added to food that’s cooked in aluminium foil. Anything acidic sparks a particularly aggressive process that dissolves layers of aluminium into food.', 'This research suggests that aluminium foil should not be used for cooking. Instead, we’d recommend using glassware or porcelain when preparing baked dishes. It’s safe to wrap cold food in foil, though not for long stretches of time because food has a shelf life and because aluminium in the foil will begin to leach into the food depending on ingredients like spices.', 'Ghada Bassioni, Associated Professor and Head of the Chemistry Department, Ain Shams University', 'This article was originally published on The Conversation.

"[""Why antibacterial soap isn't better than 'normal' soap""]","['When you buy soaps and body washes, do you reach for products labeled ""antibacterial"" hoping they’ll keep your family safer? Do you think those products will lower your risk of getting sick, spreading germs or being infected?', 'According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there isn’t enough science to show that over-the-counter (OTC) antibacterial soaps are better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. To date, the benefits of using antibacterial hand soap haven’t been proven. In addition, the wide use of these products over a long time has raised the question of potential negative effects on your health.', 'After studying the issue, including reviewing available literature and hosting public meetings, in 2013 the FDA issued a proposed rule requiring safety and efficacy data from manufacturers, consumers, and others if they wanted to continue marketing antibacterial products containing those ingredients, but very little information has been provided. That’s why the FDA is issuing a final rule under which OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (including liquid, foam, gel hand soaps, bar soaps, and body washes) containing the majority of the antibacterial active ingredients—including triclosan and triclocarban—will no longer be able to be marketed.', 'Why? Because the manufacturers haven’t proven that those ingredients are safe for daily use over a long period of time. Also, manufacturers haven’t shown that these ingredients are any more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illnesses and the spread of certain infections. Some manufacturers have already started removing these ingredients from their products, ahead of the FDA’s final rule.', '""Following simple handwashing practices is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of many types of infection and illness at home, at school and elsewhere,"" says Theresa M. Michele, MD, of the FDA’s Division of Nonprescription Drug Products. ""We can’t advise this enough. It’s simple, and it works.""', 'The FDA’s final rule covers only consumer antibacterial soaps and body washes that are used with water. It does not apply to hand sanitizers or hand wipes. It also does not apply to antibacterial soaps that are used in health care settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes.', 'What Makes Soap ‘Antibacterial’', 'Antibacterial soaps (sometimes called antimicrobial or antiseptic soaps) contain certain chemicals not found in plain soaps. Those ingredients are added to many consumer products with the intent of reducing or preventing bacterial infection.', 'Many liquid soaps labeled antibacterial contain triclosan, an ingredient of concern to many environmental, academic and regulatory groups. Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters the way some hormones work in the body and raises potential concerns for the effects of use in humans. We don’t yet know how triclosan affects humans and more research is needed.', '""There’s no data demonstrating that these drugs provide additional protection from diseases and infections. Using these products might give people a false sense of security,"" Michele says. ""If you use these products because you think they protect you more than soap and water, that’s not correct. If you use them because of how they feel, there are many other products that have similar formulations but won’t expose your family to unnecessary chemicals. And some manufacturers have begun to revise these products to remove these ingredients.""', 'How do you tell if a product is antibacterial? For OTC drugs, antibacterial products generally have the word ""antibacterial"" on the label. Also, a Drug Facts label on a soap or body wash is a sign a product contains antibacterial ingredients.', 'Triclosan and Health Concerns', 'Triclosan can be found in many places today. It has been added to many consumer products—including clothing, kitchenware, furniture, and toys—to prevent bacterial contamination. Because of that, people’s long-term exposure to triclosan is higher than previously thought, raising concerns about the potential risks associated with the use of this ingredient over a lifetime.', 'In addition, laboratory studies have raised the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Some data shows this resistance may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of medical treatments, such as antibiotics.', 'The FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been closely collaborating on scientific and regulatory issues related to triclosan. This joint effort will help to ensure government-wide consistency in the regulation of this chemical. The two agencies are reviewing the effects of triclosan from two different perspectives.', 'The EPA regulates the use of triclosan as a pesticide, and is in the process of updating its assessment of the effects of triclosan when it is used in pesticides. The FDA’s focus is on the effects of triclosan when it is used by consumers on a regular basis in hand soaps and body washes. By sharing information, the two agencies will be better able to measure the exposure and effects of triclosan and how these differing uses of triclosan may affect human health.', 'The EPA reevaluates each pesticide active ingredient every 15 years. The EPA’s Final Work Plan for the triclosan risk assessment can be found in docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0811.', 'More on the FDA’s Rule', 'The FDA’s rule doesn’t yet apply to three chemicals (benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol). Manufacturers are developing and planning to submit new safety and effectiveness data for these ingredients.', 'With the exception of those three ingredients that are still under study, all products that use the other 19 active ingredients will need to change their formulas or they will no longer be available to consumers. Manufacturers will have one year to comply with the rule.', 'This rule doesn’t apply to hand sanitizers. The FDA recently issued a final rule on OTC hand sanitizers and will continue to review the three active ingredients commonly used in hand sanitizers. To learn about the difference between consumer hand sanitizers and consumer antibacterial soaps, visit our consumer information page.', 'Consumers, Keep Washing with Plain Soap and Water', 'So what should consumers do?

['How to drive a getaway car'],"['Never mind trying to outrace another vehicle when you need to escape, says Walter Farrer, a security consultant who teaches evasive-\xaddriving courses to business executives and wealthy Mexican families who want to avoid kidnappings. Disappear instead: drive a mini\xadvan, which is like an automotive duck blind, mobile camouflage for the road. ""They make you hard to follow,"" Farrer says. A newish mini\xadvan or midsize S.U.V. in gray with no bumper stickers is ideal. ""Make sure both taillights work,"" Farrer says. ""You don’t want anything on your car that is easily identifiable."" In particularly high-risk cities — kidnappings for ransom are a persistent problem in Mexico — he presses his clients to drive cars covered in dust bearing local plates.', 'Once behind the wheel, follow a few basic rules — what Farrer calls ""habit changes"" — no matter whom your pursuers are. Vary the routes you take to work, your children’s school, the gym. Predictability makes for easy surveillance, and, as Farrer tells his students, ""routine movements are the riskiest."" Keep the windows up and the doors locked. To facilitate speedy exits, back into parking spots. Wait for a well-lit public place before pulling over, especially if it’s for a fender bender. Never tailgate: ""Give yourself space to maneuver,"" says Farrer, whose courses include instruction on how to ram through roadblocks, drive in reverse in a slalom pattern to dodge bullets and skid 180 degrees in what’s called a ""bootlegger’s turn.""', 'Still, the most basic evasive-driving lesson is one that could make better drivers of us all: be more keenly aware of your surroundings. Notice the quotidian. If something is off — a car is following, a strange roadblock looms ahead — early recognition will give you a few moments extra to react.

['You asked: Is running on a treadmill as good as running outside?'],"['To dedicated runners, running outside gets all the glory. Some purists even eschew headphones (and shoes!). But when talking about whether treadmill running is ""the same"" as running outdoors, it helps to pinpoint what sort of sameness matters to you.', 'In terms of the mechanics of your stride, there’s not much difference between running on a treadmill and running on ground, says Dr. Irene Davis, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School who has studied the differences between treadmill and over-ground running . "" While it feels much different to you, the leg motions and the forces experienced by your body are very similar between these conditions,"" Davis says.', 'But when it comes to your risk for injuries, there may be an important difference. ""Most running injuries are overloading injuries that involve muscle, cartilage, bone or tendons wearing down over time,"" Davis explains. While there isn’t a lot of good research on this, Davis says those types of injuries probably occur more frequently when you repeat the exact same running motion thousands and thousands of times—as you would on a treadmill or a flat, consistent stretch of pavement.', '""You strike the ground 1,000 times per foot, per mile,"" she says. And if you’re running on a treadmill or a flat, hard surface, the redundancy of your motion increases your risk for these overuse injuries.', 'On the other hand, Davis suspects that changing up your stride has a beneficial effect on your injury risk. The more you move in response to curbs, corners, hills or leashed pets, the less likely you are to overburden the same muscle or tendon. Running courses that include lots of slopes, speed changes, and impediments—especially nature trails—are probably safest when it comes to your risk for wear and tear, she hypothesizes.', 'But what about the effort involved in running outdoors as opposed to on a treadmill? The big factor here is ""air resistance,"" which you’ll encounter more of outdoors than you will inside, finds a much-cited study from the University of Brighton in the UK. But there’s an easy fix for treadmill runners: By raising the grade of your belt very slightly—just 1% of added incline—you’ll mimic the effects of outdoor air resistance, the study authors conclude.', 'There may also be a psychological factor to the debate. Lots of research has found that time spent outside, especially in green spaces like woods or parks, offers benefits ranging from improved mood and energy levels to better sleep. And another UK study—this one from the universities of Exeter and Essex—found that runners who ran outdoors in natural environments reported greater feelings of revitalization and wellbeing, and decreases in tension, confusion, anger and depression. (Just don’t forget sun protection .)', 'All things considered, running outdoors and on trails makes the most sense for maximizing the benefits of running.

He\'s one of the most influential composers in my life, so the first thing for me to do upon starting ""Harry Potter"" was to get rid of that huge shadow over me. I was lucky enough that, in the first ""Deathly Hallows,"" director David Yates didn\'t want to use ""Hedwig\'s Theme,"" the famous John Williams cue, because the kids were grown ups now and they were not in Hogwarts during the first episode. Funny enough, though, before I started working on the film, I didn\'t know that. I had played around with John Williams\' theme, making different versions of it. I didn\'t use any of them, though, because the theme only comes two or three times in very little portions. I was enjoying the arrangements I was doing, but there was no use for them.

That's what I did."", ""This was my first film with Ben, and my first time with Kathryn. The first time was always difficult. You have to build bridges and try to reassure the directors that you are not there to have your music playing loud, where it overwhelms the film. There's always this fear from directors that the composer wants to be the director. You learn through the years to approach that from a different angle. In a few months apart, I was able to work with two directors who had actually not used a lot of scores in their previous films, and where the scores were also not really predominant. These two films, though, it was necessary that the music was present, and I guess that's why it turned out so well."", '""Philomena"" (2013)', '""Philomena"" marks the fifth time Desplat and Frears have partnered for a film.

It\'s about her and what she suffered through for 50 years. She\'s over 70 years old, a simple woman, and the music had to reflect that in the most delicate way. That\'s something my European sensitivity most likely takes me toward. I could have almost said that we don\'t need any music. The characters and the directing is so beautiful already. You can\'t overwhelm a story with a loud score or a melody that could be too romantic or pushy. The emotions are so strong already that you just have to push a little bit and it goes as far as you can go. If you push more, it becomes cheesy.']",1

They’re shaped by the demographics of the site’s users, who skew young, middle-class, and tech-savvy. And while the sample size is large, there’s some selection bias at work. Da Poke Shack, for instance, seems more likely to be visited and reviewed by someone who already knows she loves poke than, say, a steak-lover with an aversion to raw seafood. Yelpers, by and large, tend to evaluate establishments on their own terms, which means that their top picks won’t necessarily appeal to the least common denominator.', 'That said, every restaurant-rating system worth its salt is highly subjective.

Credit: University of California, Los Angeles According to the basic laws of thermodynamics, if you leave a warm apple pie in a winter window eventually the pie would cool down to the same temperature as the surrounding air.', 'For chemists and physicists, cooling samples of charged particles, also called ions, makes them easier to control and study. So they use a similar approach—called buffer gas cooling—to lower the temperature of ions by trapping them and then immersing them in clouds of cold atoms. Collisions with the atoms cool the originally hot ions by transferring energy from the ions to the atoms—much the same way a warm pie is cooled next to the cold window, said Eric Hudson, associate professor of physics at UCLA.', 'But new research by Hudson and his team, published in the journal Nature Communications, demonstrates that ions never truly cool to the temperature of the surrounding gas. Also, very surprisingly, they discovered that under certain conditions, two final temperatures exist, and the temperature that the ions choose depends on their starting temperature.', '""This apparent departure from the familiar laws of thermodynamics is akin to our warm apple pie either cooling as expected or spontaneously bursting into flames, depending on the pie\'s exact temperature when it is placed in the window,"" said Hudson, the senior author of the study.', 'The UCLA researchers have, for the first time, placed fundamental limits on the use of buffer gas cooling in ""ion traps."" To perform their experiment, the researchers prepared a microscopic sample of laser cooled ions of the chemical element barium and immersed them in clouds of roughly 3 million laser-cooled calcium atoms. The researchers make molecules extremely cold under highly controlled conditions to reveal the quantum mechanical properties that are normally hidden.', 'The ions were trapped in an apparatus that levitates charged particles by using electric fields that oscillate millions of times per second, confining the ions to a region smaller than the width of a human hair. Both the atomic and ionic samples were brought to ultra-cold temperatures —just one-thousandth of a degree above absolute zero—via a technique in which the momentum of light in a laser is used to slow particle motion.', 'After allowing collisions between the atoms and ions to occur and the system to reach its final temperature, the physicists removed the calcium atoms and measured the temperature of the barium ions. The results, which show the existence of multiple final temperatures based on ion number and initial temperature, suggest that subtle non-equilibrium physics is at play.', 'The researchers trace these strange features to the heating and cooling rates which exist in the system—the peculiar temperature dependence of the interaction among multiple ions in an ion trap. Both simulation and theory support their experimental findings, and paint the buffer-gas cooling process as a fundamentally nuanced, non-equilibrium process rather than the straightforward equilibrium process it was originally understood to be.', 'Lead author Steven Schowalter, a graduate student researcher in Hudson\'s laboratory and now a staff scientist at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said, ""Our results demonstrate that you can\'t just throw any buffer gas into your device—no matter how cold it is—and expect it to work as an effective coolant.""', ""Buffer gas cooling is crucial in fields ranging from forensics to the production of antimatter.

When he was fired by the former head scribe, Ron Carlivati, and was written out of the storyline, the audience came unglued. They didn’t want to say goodbye to Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) and demanded ABC do something about it and rehire the actor.', 'Easton taped his first scenes yesterday. Very exciting stuff. #GH — Frank Valentini (@valentinifrank) February 27, 2016', 'Michael Easton revealed in an interview with ABC Soaps In Depth that he was disappointed when he learned he would no longer be on General Hospital. Easton felt his character deserved a better exit than to be murdered by Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills) in a ploy to take control of Nina Clay’s (Michelle Stafford) assets. Easton also felt his character hadn’t run its course, and there was no reason to kill him off in that manner. Even so, Carlivati murdered Dr. Silas and Port Charles (and General Hospital fans) was left reeling after his shocking murder.', 'Right after his exit from the General Hospital, his fans launched an online petition calling for the ABC executives to consider bringing Michael back on the soap opera. The petition fetched an astonishing 14,000 signatures–which was enough to grab the attention of the powers that be at ABC. The creator of the petition, Laura Gentili, stated that the audience wanted Michael Easton back on the soap opera as Dr. Silas Clay.

In many ways, trying to protect individuals from sex only hurts them further.""', 'He argues education will also ensure those with less mainstream sexual desires experience less shame and stigma and feel part of the conversation.', '""Transparency around sex leads to a more humanistic, supportive, and nurturing society, that is accepting of individuality and unique consensual behaviours, rather one that is authoritarian, patriarchal, and punitive.

That’s almost half the number of people who use Twitter, which took three years to build up a comparable following. At its simplest, Musical.ly is a music video maker combining features of Snapchat, Instagram and Vine. Its founder, Alex Zhu, came up with the idea after spotting teens on a train filming themselves listening to music on headphones.', 'In the app, Musers choose from a library of more than a million songs, select a 15-second snippet, then lip-synch to it exuberantly while filming themselves, typically in selfie mode. Increasingly, people perform comedy skits, dances or lip-synchs to film dialogue. Some, such as Max and Harvey, sing for real as well as lip-synch. They can add filters and Snapchat-style face adornments (selecting ""swag"" adds a gold chain and a black cap). Musical.lys, as the looping clips are known, are then shared with followers. Live.ly, launched in June, a live-streaming sister app, gives Musers the freedom to broadcast anything, for 20 minutes at a time on average.', 'The twins lead a tribe of 2.5m Musers in the UK, most of them aged 13 to 24. At the time of writing, their joint account has 2.48m followers (they gain about 10,000 new fans a day). They never drop off the top of the UK leaderboard, and routinely feature in the global top 10. In the US, home to half of all Musers, the biggest stars have more than 10m fans. Musical.ly, which has about 120 staff in Shanghai and Los Angeles, estimates that half of all American teenagers now have the app. Teen by teen, it is holding up a mirror to a new generation of digital natives, and changing the music industry.', 'Musical.ly features videos it likes on the app’s homepage; the sudden exposure means Musers can get very big, very quickly. The app’s biggest stars now have agents, merchandise and, in some cases, record deals. It’s why Max and Harvey, who signed up in March, are making a real-life music video, with their own voices – they want to take their success to the next level. Today’s shoot, and a session in a recording studio yesterday, have been arranged by Cassie Petrey, who runs Crowdsurf, a digital marketing firm in Los Angeles, and Tim Byrne, the British former creative director at Syco Entertainment, Simon Cowell’s label (Byrne now runs Fandom Management, also based in LA).', 'When Petrey was 12 and at school in Kentucky, she made an online Backstreet Boys fanzine. Years later, while working for record labels in Nashville, she alerted executives to a new website called Myspace, and ran pages for artists. Now 30, but ""still a fangirl at heart"", she looks for talent on Musical.ly. She says the app is changing the game. ""Max and Harvey did a Live.ly a couple of days ago, and there were, like, 50,000 people watching it at once,"" she says by phone (the boys were fooling around at Alton Towers). ""I’ve never seen live-streaming figures like that on any platform."" Musical.ly also has a uniquely young audience, which partly explains the sense, outside the app, of a quiet rise to prominence. ""I see kids commenting all the time that they can’t follow talent on other platforms, because their parents only let them use Musical.ly,"" Petrey says.', 'Max and Harvey had about 150,000 followers when Petrey spotted them. She says she knew immediately that they could be stars. Her job now is to work on their digital output beyond Musical.ly (they need no help there). They now have almost 10 social media profiles, including a YouTube channel (3.9m views and counting). Engagement is the buzzword in this world, and Musical.ly succeeds by appearing to blur the line between idols and idolisers. Popular Musers are part of the community that sustains them, and a couple of featured clips can be all it takes for anyone to make it big. Really big.', 'First came YouTube, where Justin Bieber put up his first video almost a decade ago, then Vine. ""Now people are saying, ‘I want to be a Muser’, and we have the resources to make that happen,"" says Tiffany Au, 28, director of communications at Collab, a ""digital talent network and entertainment studio"" in LA. The firm helps about 400 digital creators, including Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel. She is from South Florida, has just turned 16 and is by some distance Musical.ly’s biggest star with – let’s just check the latest figure – 15m fans. She got the app a little over a year ago, after a friend showed it to her. In those early days, Musers were uploading static lip-synchs. ""I was like, how do I make this interesting,"" Baby Ariel says, ""so I decided to use hand motions and thought, oh, this is actually pretty cool.""', 'She has turned phone holding into an art form, and has been imitated by millions of Musers. In one recent clip, she lip-synchs to the Chainsmokers’ hit Closer (it ambitiously rhymes ""back seat of your Rover"" with ""tattoo on your shoulder""). Turning her phone into a choreographic aid, she makes it move around her face in time with the music, like a hummingbird sizing up a flower. While she chews gum through an exaggerated smile, mouthing the words ""so baby pull me closer"", she uses her free hand to draw the camera in. She says her clips can take between 20 and 90 minutes to create.', 'Before long, Baby Ariel was getting recognised. ""This girl came up to me in Old Navy and I was like, ‘No way, this is crazy. This is not a real thing’."" She later left school to study online, so that she could devote more time to Musical.ly, alongside her mother Sharon. She is now a ""social media influencer"" with aspirations to act. She speaks to me from LA between auditions at Disney and Nickelodeon. She is also in town to join Jacob Sartorius on his US tour. Sartorius, 14, has more than 12m fans, and now records original music. Sweatshirt, his first single (""Girl, you can wear my sweatshirt, ’cause you’re the only one I hold, And I don’t want you to be cold"") made the iTunes top 10 and has more than 35m YouTube views. At the Troubadour club in Santa Monica, where, in 1970, Neil Diamond introduced Elton John to America, Baby Ariel DJ’d while Jacob Sartorius of Oklahoma performed Sweatshirt to a sellout crowd.', 'Fans are desperate to meet star Musers – and each other. When 17-year-old Violet Summersby noticed this in comments, she arranged a meet-up in New York. A dozen or so big names mingled with about 300 fans. Fifteen free events followed in cities across the US. Now the co-founder and CEO of Muser Movement, Summersby hosted the first ticketed meet-up in LA in November. As well as encouraging engagement, she believes the app reflects a healthier relationship between young people and social media. ""It doesn’t matter what you look like,"" she says. ""If you’re funny or you’ve got something to say, you can put it out there. Social media is changing now. There was this idea that you had to look like Kim Kardashian to be famous. That’s not the case any more. You can be whoever you want to be, and that’s now acceptable. It’s not acceptable to be something that you’re not. People want to see your true self.""', 'It’s a stirring vision, but it doesn’t immediately square with the high proportion of telegenic, zit-free teens among Musical.ly’s upper ranks, or with concerns about safety and privacy on the app. It is also clear that a significant proportion of Musers are younger than 13, the minimum age for app store downloads. There have been sporadic reports of attempted grooming via the app, and concerns about inappropriate lyrics and content; at least two UK police forces have reportedly investigated complaints by parents. But Musical.ly encourages parents to monitor use of the app, and says it removes inappropriate content within 15 minutes; it adds that concerned Musers or their parents should consider sacrificing potential fame and make their accounts private. All those I speak to, however, report seeing less nasty stuff, if any at all, on Musical.ly than elsewhere. Moreover, even if the top Musers resemble the glossy Mickey Mouse Club stars of yore, they believe that, for now at least, Musical.ly offers a freedom of expression and control that would have been alien to Britney Spears. ""Musical.ly has allowed me to find who I am as a person,"" Baby Ariel says. ""Before social media, I didn’t know who I was or what I wanted to do. Now I do.""', 'Six months ago, no one would have ever approached us unless they were asking for directions', 'Where Musers find freedom and community, the music industry sees dollar signs. All the major labels make their tracks available on the app, which mobilises a bedroom battalion of promoters. In August, the label Republic reported a 23% increase in sales of Hailee Steinfeld’s Starving after a promotion on Musical.ly. In the UK, Olly Murs of X Factor fame launched a #Challenge, another popular feature of the app, to promote a single on his new album 24 HRS. He lip-synched to Grow Up while wearing face filters, including a teddy bear’s nose. ""Create your own ‘Grow Up’ lip-synch video & you could win a signed copy of 24 HRS,"" he wrote under his Musical.ly.

['7 family finance tips to get you ready for 2017:'],"['With the New Year fast approaching, many of us are thinking of goals and priorities for the coming year. Personal and family finances should be high on the list of important areas to consider. Spending just a few minutes on some key areas of your financial life can help you start 2017 on the right financial note. Here are a 7 important items to consider:', '1. Make a family budget so you understand your discretionary income. Doing a budget may not sound like fun, but it is important in helping you understand your monthly cash flow and discretionary income: the amount of money you earn after taxes, the amount you spend on essential living costs, and any leftover amount, which is your discretionary income. How much of your discretionary income you spend and how much you save may be one of the most important decisions you make in your financial life. Well-known web sites like BudgetTracker.com  or mint.com make it easy to get started. As an added bonus, in doing your budget, you may identify areas where you can save and thus increase your discretionary income.', ""2. Review your cost of debt and keep more of your own money. If possible, find ways to reduce the cost of your debt. Consumer debt can be costly, and it isn't tax deductible. On the other hand, home-equity lines of credit are tax deductible and may be a lower-cost source of cash than credit card debt or auto loans. If you embark on this strategy, be sure to be very disciplined and not to use your home equity line like a piggy bank."", '3. Automatically increase your 401(k) or other retirement plan contributions. Raising the percentage of your income that you defer into your qualified retirement plan can be very easy. Simply call your human resources office or go to your 401(k) plan provider website and increase the contribution amount into your 401(k) or other retirement plan. A small and relatively painless annual increase, perhaps when you get a raise, can mean a big difference later in life. Also, check if your employer offers a way to automatically increase to your salary deferral percentage each year.', ""4. Consolidate retirement accounts. Americans are changing jobs more often than they have in the past, and this can result in multiple accounts and overlapping investments. It is not uncommon for someone to have several 401(k) plan accounts at former employers. Consolidating them takes time, and people often consider it a hassle or are simply confused by the process. Calling your 401(k) plan provider can help you start the process. You can consider adding these assets to your current employer's 401(k) plan or setting up a rollover IRA. Once the number of your accounts is reduced, it may be easier to make changes, coordinate your overall asset allocation, and track performance."", '5. Analyze your risk tolerance and asset allocation. A new year is a good time to evaluate your portfolio to be sure it still reflects your current thinking on the markets and that it is structured in line with your goals and objectives. Be aware of potential style drift (a shift away from your intended asset allocation, usually as a result of market movements) and if there are areas to your portfolio that can potentially be improved upon. You may be able to complete this yourself or with the help of some online software. If not, look for a qualified financial advisor who may be able to offer his or her assessment.', '6. Conduct a beneficiary review on your retirement plans, annuities, and insurance policies. The beneficiaries named in these accounts take precedent over any legal document you create. Therefore, you need to review each of these.', ""I recently worked on settling an estate for a client. Even though I knew this person for almost 20 years, I didn't know about an old life insurance policy. Evidently, neither did anyone else. My client's ex-wife, whom he had divorced more than 20 years earlier, was still the beneficiary on this sizable policy that paid her several hundred thousand dollars. Despite their acrimonious divorce, and even though there was no intention of enriching the ex-wife, she nevertheless received the generous insurance checks within weeks of my client's death. Worse yet, those funds increased his taxable estate, so this policy actually cost his children and other beneficiaries some money in taxes. This is a dramatic example, but it's a good reminder to verify that your beneficiaries are current and your legal documents reflect your wishes."", ""7. Review the adequacy of your insurance, especially if you have children. While it's great and more fun to be concerned about buying the latest American Girl doll or Star Wars Lego's kit, don't forget to consider buying life insurance to protect your children's future. The good news is that term life insurance can be relatively inexpensive. Remember, for two-earner families, you may want to insure both parents' incomes, as the surviving parent may want or need to spend more time with the children and work less. Insurance companies will typically offer up to 10 to 12 times annual income in coverage."", 'Making sure these areas of your financial plan are in proper order can help you start off the New Year feeling confident and empowered to reach your goals. If you and your family are resolving to improve your financial fitness, these 7 tips can be a great way to start.']",1

This means they’ve been unhappy for much longer than they needed to be. One reason to get into therapy early is to get ahead of the curve and address issues before they become problems."" ― Zach Brittle, a therapist and founder of the online couples therapy series forBetter', '""Couples who reach out earlier for support when things are amiss often head off a caustic, ugly pattern of hurting each other in ways that are hard to forget or forgive. Marriage therapists should be able to help partners identify the ways they express themselves when they are hurt or angry and to recognize how they may unintentionally put their partners on the defensive.""― Linda Lipshutz, a psychotherapist in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida', '""In my opinion, the ideal time for couple’s therapy is pre-engagement. Like, way pre-engagement ― pre-ring, pre-asking-for-blessings. When you both agree that marriage to one another is a solid possibility for your future, that’s when to schedule a handful of appointments of pre-engagement counseling. So many of the issues I see from long-married couples stem from fundamental problems that could have been caught long before the wedding: People who suddenly realize two years after marriage they have opposing views on whether or not to have children. Couples who have wildly different stances on spending and saving. Couples who suffer for years due to different attitudes toward sex that emerged long after their wedding. A few sessions with a therapist who can ask the hard questions could save you from years of misery or at least let you know what you’re signing up for."" ― Ryan Howes, a psychologist in Pasadena, California', '""When issues remain unresolved, resentment can create a large and ugly divide between two people.

Go to therapy before arguments seem insurmountable because one or both of you have become apathetic."" ― Talia Wagner, a marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles, California', '""I’d say roughly two-thirds of all relationship problems are perpetual. That means they’ll be around for the duration of the relationship and, for the most part, will be unsolvable. Couples waste a lot of time trying to solve unsolvable problems. Therapy can help you prioritize ‘repair,’ or staying connected over ‘resolution,’ which is often out of reach."" ― Zach Brittle', '""I often share a folksy old saying with my clients: ‘It’s best to fix the roof when the sun’s shining.’ We all know that when we’re in the midst of crisis we make hasty, impulsive decisions that strive for immediate safety instead of long-term sustainability. Maybe you’ve noticed the relationship is strained every time a partner has a job change and you see a new career shift on the horizon. The wise choice may be to go to counseling now, when things are still calm, to learn tools to cope with the changes. It’s OK to go to counseling when things seem ‘fine’ so that you are more resilient when they aren’t. Even the strongest marriages will encounter tough times eventually, and it’s good to be equipped when they come."" ― Ryan Howes', '""Finding yourself regularly feeling disappointed and flat about your relationship is no small thing. Getting help early is more likely to be beneficial than waiting because you’re probably both still open to change and not yet so resentful or tired, to stop wanting to try. Sadly, one of the most common mistakes couples make is to shut their eyes and keep falling deeper into resentment and avoidance of growing distance, hoping things will just magically fix themselves.

It was a tough year full of political disappointments, celebrity dramas, and devastating deaths. 2017 is a new chapter, though, and there’s plenty of time for us to rewrite the story. As the whole world makes their own New Year’s resolutions during the holiday season, you might notice that almost all of them are outwardly focused. People want to lose weight, go to the gym more, or start a new kind of diet. What if you made the choice to love your body more than ever in the upcoming year, though? Without trying to change what you look like?', 'HelloGiggles spoke with Annie Robinson, M.S., wellness coach and co-founder of Pause Breathe and Connect, who says it’s much healthier to put aside the promises that are meant to transform our physique, and instead focus on making ourselves feel more alive and healthy. In other words, let’s learn how to embrace and appreciate our body, rather than judge it. ""Central to overcoming distorted perceptions of your body and self is to cultivate self-compassion and self-confidence,"" Robinson says. Gaining self-esteem doesn’t come from losing weight or eating less cake. It all starts by feeling more comfortable with the exact person you looked at in the mirror this morning.', 'Here are seven little ways you can love your body more in 2017.', 'You have all the reasons in the world to love who you are and be grateful for the body you’ve got here and now. Nobody can fulfill the job of being your biggest fan like you can. Let 2017 be the year when you form a daily habit that’s easy to maintain, yet packs a big punch of positivity — give yourself a daily affirmation.', 'Pick an affirmation or a quote that inspires you and makes you feel comfortable in your own skin. ""Perhaps write it on a card and hang it on your fridge, or place it next to your bed,"" Robinson recommends. Every time you pass by this nugget of encouragement, you’ll feel a rush of optimism that will carry you through tough parts of your day. If this sounds too cheesy for you from the bat, don’t worry. That’s normal. But give it a shot anyway. You might be surprised at how good it feels to say nice things to yourself.', 'When the New Year comes knocking on our doors, we’re bombarded with dieting methods that will help us lose weight, because apparently we overate during the holidays (hogwash, in our opinion). Losing weight is the number one New Year’s resolution in America, so a there will likely be a lot of people around you who will become focused on shedding pounds.', 'Robinson tells HelloGiggles that shifting the focus from your diet to how you feel internally will serve you so much better in the upcoming year. ""It’s not actually about what you eat or how often you go to the gym—it’s about your relationship with yourself,"" she says. So instead of worrying about eating less bread or less chocolate, just focus on how you can have some fun and feel more fulfilled.', 'Every body is different, but we’re rarely shown any diversity on the cover of magazines and on TV. The women we see are overwhelmingly thin, tall, white, and big-breasted. If you don’t have the same figure (let’s face it, most of us don’t), looking constantly at all these women’s posts on social media will likely cause our self-esteem to plummet.', 'One small change you can make in your social media life is to switch up which profiles you spend the most time looking at. Choose to follow the people who look more like you and you feel better represent you. You’ll be less inclined to judge or compare yourself to others.', 'The benefits of exercising reach far and wide, and it does so much more for your body than just helping you stay toned and fit. Working out sharpens your memory, helps you sleep better at night, and, best of all, improve your moods and boost your self-confidence. If you’re not a gym kinda gal, don’t go lift weights. If you’re not a yoga kinda gal, don’t go to all those vinyasa flow classes your friends love. Find something you enjoy, so it’s not a chore to get your heart rate up. Rather, it’s something you love doing that feels like an escape from every day life.', 'Robinson also urges us to move away from the ""get fitter"" push that often gets passed around during this time of year. It implies that ""you are falling short right now,"" she says. Instead of convincing yourself that your fitness level isn’t good enough, just find a way to move your body that brings you joy.', 'It’s like that scene in Mean Girls when the four Plastics stand in front of the mirror and criticize themselves: ""I’ve got man shoulders;"" ""My nail beds suck;"" ""My hairline is so weird."" We’ve all done it before with our friends, and we’ve all got parts of our body that we’re insecure about. Let 2017 be the year that we stop putting ourselves down, though, and get rid of the negative dialogue in our heads. The kinder we are to ourselves, the happier our body will be.', 'Because of the overload of diet-based New Year’s resolutions, Robinson says it’s easy for people to ""engage in disordered behaviors with food."" We get obsessed with following a specific diet, and then we punish ourselves for eating too much chocolate or failing to eat enough vegetables. All that wasted energy could be better spent actually enjoying our food, rather than using it as a tool to alter our bodies.', '""Social media is a mixed bag,"" Robinson tells HelloGiggles. ""On the one hand, it can be triggering and brew competition and comparison. On the other, it can create really empowering and supportive communities that uplift and encourage people to progress on their healing journey."" Moving in the New Year, it’s important to recognize who you surround yourself with online, and whether they’re lifting you up or dragging you down.', 'Do a Facebook and Instagram cleanse before the start of January, and get rid of all the people whose values you don’t align with. What we fill our heads with has an immense impact on how we feel about ourselves. Also, consider how much time you spend on social media.

When the duo came together in Karan Arjun, they totally set the screen on fire and left us looking forward to more such super hits to please their fans. But somewhere in between things went haywire and our Karan Arjun split. However, the after all the speculations made by the media, both Salman and SRK cleared their woes and said that the two have got back to being good friends.', 'We all have been aware of the two major releases of our two favourite Khans. The typical tradition that these have been following, of releasing their movies on particular occasions continued this time too. While ‘Sultan’ released on ‘Eid,’ the release of ‘Raees’ was postponed. When the 50-year-old was asked about the reason behind this delay, here’s what he had to say,', '""We have two reasons (for not releasing Raees with Sultan). One is, me and Salman spoke about it that big films have their level release wise. They should get released in at least 3500 to 4000 theatres at one time. We all have faced it at certain, point of time that two big films came together and did not get the desired theatrical release. This is quite a bog loss for the budget of the film. Till the time we have eight to nine thousand theatres for release of two big films, this cannot happen."" He further added, ""Second part was, we were still working on it and it was injured. I have still some portions to shoot for a day. But the film is ready. We thought of an alternate date in this year. But some other big film was coming then""', 'SRK mentioned that the probable release date could be January 25 or 26.

So hopefully we will come out on 25th or 26th January now. We have time. A little bit of work is left. I have not given my last shot still now. I knew Hrithik’s film was coming but he had not started the film then. We talked to Hrithik and Riteish (Sidhwani), Farhan (Akhtar) are meeting him and Rakeshji (Roshan) on 11th or 12th this month. Then they will finalise on what’s to be done.""', 'Well, looks like we’d never get to see the two releasing their movies together on one day.

"[""The World's Simplest Breakfast You're Probably Too Scared to Try""]","['To your typical eggs-and-bacon American, there’s not much about tamago gohan that makes sense. The Japanese breakfast is nothing more than a large raw egg cracked over a mound of steamed rice. If you feel like having an extra luxurious morning, you can splash the combination with soy sauce and/or speckle it with a shake or two of sesame seeds. Then, using chopsticks, you vigorously swirl the mixture into a froth and devour.', 'The first time I heard about tamago gohan was in college. I worked the lunch shift at a sushi bar, where I had the good fortune of joining the owner, Tencho, and my co-worker, a petite Japanese woman named Shoko, for breakfast. Each morning, Shoko would simmer a stockpot of miso soup, I’d wash and cook the rice, and Tencho would slice sashimi.', 'We’d then sit in the sunny corner of the restaurant, NHK news on the television, the spread before us. I’d hover above my bowl of miso soup and allow the steam to kiss my skin awake. I’d feel the warm rice quiet my grumbling gut. I’d inhale the sensuous slices of salmon, snapper, and yellowtail.', 'As a white kid who grew up in Eastern Pennsylvania, I had a healthy fear of salmonella. My grandmother used to pull her potato salad from the table the moment a sunbeam struck it. Tamago gohan made me a little nervous (and where was the obligatory pork product?). I\'d watch my boss crack, stir, and inhale with the nonchalance associated with pouring a bowl of cereal. Did this man secretly possess an iron-lined stomach? It took Tencho several months of prodding, of him repeating, ""You are not man,"" before I could accept a bowl of rice topped with a quivering, uncooked egg.', 'It quickly became one of my favorite comfort meals. Tamago gohan possesses the rib-sticking satisfaction of oatmeal, and the simplicity of sushi. The egg, when incorporated into the rice, relaxes each grain, and, with it, the rest of the morning. Pops of nuttiness, provided by the sesame seeds, punctuate every few bites. The salty spike of the soy sauce balances the grassy brashness of brewed green tea, which you hopefully also have close at hand.', 'As Shoko taught me, it’s rude to leave even a single grain of rice in the bowl. So I spend the last few moments of breakfast meticulously plucking the remaining morsels with the tips of my chopsticks. I cup the bowl with my hand to feel the warmth of the rice through the ceramic. The process is meditative and, ultimately, lends a sense of closure to the meal.', 'You probably think I’m overselling tamago gohan. But I still feel different as an eater after finishing a bowl of the stuff then, say, after a Monte Cristo. Even piled-high breakfast sandwiches can\'t compete with the satisfaction of finishing a simple bowl of egg and rice. And maybe Tencho’s refrain of ""you are not man"" was less a jab than it was a philosophy. Finishing a bowl of tamago gohan somehow makes you feel more complete.', 'It’s been nearly a decade since I last ate with Tencho and Shoko, but I still crave our breakfasts—and the bowls of tamago gohan that accompanied them. Occasionally, on a lazy Sunday, I’ll shuffle into the kitchen, rinse a cup or so of rice, steam it in a pot, gently crack an egg over the mixture, and then sit down to reminisce.', 'Tomago Gohan', 'Yields: 1, with leftover rice', '1, with leftover rice Cook Time: 20 minutes', '20 minutes Hands-On Time: 5 minutes', '5 minutes Total Time: 25 minutes', 'Ingredients', '1 1⁄2 cups uncooked sushi rice', '2 cups water, plus more for rinsing', '1 piece dried kombu, about the size of a playing card (optional)', '1 large egg', 'Soy sauce and sesame seeds, to taste', 'Directions']",1

Money would be saved because the Pentagon would not need to buy as many planes, nor would unmanned systems have to fly as many flight hours for training purposes. Moreover, it would afford the Navy a way to extend the reach of its carrier air wing so that naval aviation could strike deep into the heart of heavily defended enemy territory.', '""The cost savings are just tremendous,"" said Paul Scharre, one of the authors of the study and director of the 20YY Future of Warfare Initiative at the Center for a New American Security.', 'According to the study, the cost savings estimates top $100 billion.

Under the most modest case scenario, the savings range between $30 billion and $54 billion.', 'Scharre makes the argument that when a ""pilot"" or drone operator ""flies"" an unmanned aerial vehicle, the human is only really making macro-level decisions rather than directly flying the machine—particularly in more advanced drones. Basically, even if the pilots were to maintain their proficiency in simulators only, it would make little difference to that operator. As far as that operator were concerned, the input or data coming into the simulator would be identical whether the drone as simulated, flying over Southern California or flying over Iraq. ""It may be indistinguishable to the operator,"" Scharre said. ""They might not even know.""', 'That means that the Pentagon could save huge sums of money because pilots would not need to fly to maintain currency or fly peacetime training missions. Only a few aircraft would be needed to retain the skills of maintenance crews for operations at home station. The rest of the aircraft could be deployed for operational usage.', '""The report is really about cost,"" Scharre said. ""The cost of the airframe is identical. If you’re building a combat aircraft it’s going to have certain requirements in terms of speed, range, low visibility, weapons and everything else—those drive the cost of the aircraft. The cockpit costs are negligible. All of the saving come out of the training hours and the hours to keep up pilot currency. But then that has follow-on effects on the number of aircraft you buy, and that’s where there are huge savings.""', 'Right now, the Navy has 10 air wings for its fleet of 10 carriers, however only a few of those carriers are deployed at sea with an air wing onboard. The remainder of the air wings and carriers are either in training or maintenance. Even during a surge, the Navy might at best deploy six carriers and their air wings, Scharre said. With a fleet of unmanned combat aircraft, the Navy would only have to buy enough unmanned combat aircraft to fill six air wings and its maintenance pipeline—which would significantly reduce the number of jets that the service would need. ""You’re not buying 10 air wings,"" Scharre said—but nonetheless, each deployed carrier would retain the same—if not greater—combat capability.', 'However, while Scharre said that he hopes the CNAS study will influence the Navy’s on-going F/A-XX or Next Generation Air Dominance analysis of alternatives (AOA), he said he recognizes the carrier air wing will never be fully unmanned. More realistically, the future carrier air wing will be a mix of manned and unmanned systems. And, indeed, Scharre said that it would be preferable to retain a combination of human and autonomous control. ""I think there is a role for unmanned combat aircraft on the carrier deck from an operational standpoint,"" Scharre said. ""But it’s unreasonable to think—and I don’t know that anyone is suggesting—that the Navy go to an all-unmanned carrier air wing.""', 'The CNAS report is not about what the mission of a future Navy unmanned combat aircraft might be. It’s simply about the potential savings the service could achieve with increased numbers of unmanned aircraft. ""We would like to see the Navy incorporate cost analysis into their AOA,"" Scharre said. ""In particular as they evaluate manned, unmanned and optionally manned variants of an F/A-XX —that they think about cost.""']",1
['Crytek Dev Explains Why E3 Demos Rarely Match the Final Game'],"['With E3 2016 just around the corner, Crytek’s Rok Erjavec explains why some games receive demos at the expo that appear to be more polished than their retail release.', 'With E3 2016 nearly upon us, many gamers are excited to see exactly what the expo will have in store. With both recently announced games such as Battlefield 1 expected to offer more information than what we already know, and the obvious hope for some exciting games that have yet to be revealed, there is one concern that may rear its ugly head in a very pretty way – stunning E3 demos that do not match up to the finished product. One developer, however, has spoken out about exactly why these demos seem to offer up a much more polished experience than their final version.', 'Rok Erjavec, Crytek’s technical director, recently spoke about this issue with DSO Gaming. Although the interview primarily focuses on the technical side of things, particularly regarding DirectX 12, the Crytek technical director did touch on the controversy surrounding games being downgraded from their E3 demos and showcases. Although Erjavec does understand some of the problems with this strategy, the technical director feels that ""in many cases, the criticism is misplaced.""', 'Erjavec went on to explain that the nature of these demos often causes this change in perceived graphical quality. ""Trade-show demos are often carefully crafted experiences where a highly-polished single area is shown during the demo,"" said the technical director. He continued to explain that many developers are given a task of completing a 15-minute part of the game, but with a timeframe of building it in three to six months, while the rest of the game’s content is built over 12 to 24 months.', 'What this comes down to, then, is not so much an attempt to deceive players, and more just the difficulty of creating a full gaming experience in a much more pressured timeframe. ""In many cases there was no downgrade as such,"" explained Erjavec, ""just the reality of producing much more content over what effectively amounts to (much) less time."" However, the technical director did suggested that one kind of demo is hardly useful for the developer or for its audience, stating that ""I do find gameplay showcases that aren’t running on actual hardware targets or are entirely pre-recorded a bit pointless, since games are fundamentally about interactive experiences.""', 'Regardless of exactly how demos are misleading gamers, it’s doubtful that the most blatant perpetrators of superior demos will get a free ride from the gaming community. Games such as Aliens: Colonial Marines will live long in the memory of players, with a final version of the game so bad that it led to a long and painful lawsuit. Indeed, in spite of some stunning demo footage, it has taken until 2016 for users to make the game playable through modded content.', 'Although Erjavec’s comments provide a very useful context for those outside of the game development circuit, it is perhaps still important for those games with the largest discrepancies to be called out on it. After all, Ubisoft promised to change its release policies after the notoriety gained from Watch Dogs. That said, maybe with a bit more understanding of how games are made, perhaps gamers will be a little more lenient on games that only lack a little polish upon release.', 'Source: DSO Gaming']",1

While Manning was being treated at the hospital, doctors noticed a growth on his penis and diagnosed him with life-threatening penile cancer. Doctors removed ""most of his penis,"" leaving him with ""a stump about an inch long.""', 'Manning had to sit down to pee and couldn\'t have intimate relationships with women, he told the Times. But a penis transplant wasn\'t possible at the time. It had been attempted only twice worldwide — and only once successfully, in South Africa. But Manning ""kept my eye on the prize,"" he said.', 'After three and a half years of research, surgeons at MGH performed Manning\'s penis transplant earlier this month, the hospital announced today. Doctors are ""cautiously optimistic"" that it\'ll return the functions Manning lost in his 2012 amputation.', 'Eventually, the surgery may help treat soldiers with genitourinary injuries. More than 1,300 men in the military sustained genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013, the Times reported in December.', '""We are delighted to have taken the first steps to help those patients who have suffered silently for far too long,"" Dr. Dicken Ko, one of the surgeons who led the procedure, said in a statement.', 'More than 1,300 men in the military sustained genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013.', 'How a penis transplant works', ""First, surgeons have to procure a donor penis matching the patient's skin tone and blood type."", '""The penis donor must be fairly young and have very healthy blood vessels to prevent erectile dysfunction,"" Dr. Amy Friedman, medical director at LiveOnNY, said in an emailed statement on Monday. ""As with any organ, if it didn\'t function in the donor, it won\'t function in the recipient.""', ""Then, to perform the transplant, surgeons need to attach it to the patient's arteries, veins, nerves, skin and urethra."", 'It isn\'t an easy process. ""The blood vessels that are attached to penis are quite small,"" Dr. Lee Zhao, an assistant professor of Urology at NYU Langone Medical Center who wasn\'t involved in Manning\'s penis transplant, said in a phone call Monday. He put it this way: If the artery to a kidney is 1 centimeter, the artery to a penis may only be 2 or 3 millimeters.', '""The techniques to do some of the connections for those blood vessels and nerves have taken a long time to develop,"" Zhao said.', 'Does it function like a penis?', 'That\'s the goal. Manning\'s new penis will allow urine to pass through it, and doctors are ""cautiously optimistic that sexual function will be restored,"" according to a fact sheet.', 'That may take time, according to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where a penis transplant program is also underway. Nerves grow at a rate of 1 millimeter per day — or 1 inch per month. ""We anticipate that achieving function, including urinary and sexual functioning, could take between six to 12 months,"" its website says.', 'The procedure is similar to cases where patients have severed their own penises and need to have them reattached, Zhao said. In those situations, ""patients are able to achieve erections.""', 'As for ejaculation, ""it occurs in male patients who do not have a penis,"" Zhao said. ""That should not be affected."" Like urine, the semen will flow through the reattached urethra.', ""Fathering children is possible, too — provided a patient's testes are still intact. In fact, the recipient of the world's first penis transplant conceived a child with his girlfriend last year, CNN reported."", 'Exciting — but somewhat controversial.', ""Physically speaking, losing a penis isn't life-threatening, like heart failure. Are penis transplants worth a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs, which come with a number of unpleasant side effects?"", '""Since there are alternative techniques for making a penis, you really have to weigh the risks and benefits of doing a penis transplant,"" Zhao said.', 'One alternative technique is constructing a ""neophallus"" — a new penis made from tissue from a patient\'s forearm or thigh. Patients with a neophallus require a penile prosthesis to achieve an erection, Zhao said. They don\'t need to take immunosuppressants, since their new organs come from their own bodies.', 'But in some cases — such as the wounded soldiers approved for penis transplants at Johns Hopkins — patients have lost too much tissue from their penises to construct a neophallus, according to Popular Science. If they want to restore their penises, transplantation is the only option.', 'Future transplants mean we\'ll need more donors.

Our work is basically problem-solving: helping couples communicate about sex, helping individuals feel more confident sexually, and working through deeper issues around love and relationships. We certainly don’t stand in the corner of bedrooms with a clipboard.', '2. And we don’t have sex with our patients either.', 'You’re thinking of sex surrogates, and that’s a very different thing. Surrogates work closely with individuals who are having sexual problems, and part of that work can involve having sex with their clients. We just talk about sex – we don’t do it.', '3. People have absolutely no idea how to react when we tell them what we do.', 'And the responses we do get tend to be inappropriate, e.g. ""Ooh, I could do with some help from you!"" or ""Well, a sex therapist is the last thing I need, I get laid all the time."" Come on, we just met you at a party, we don’t need to know that.', '4. We sometimes use explicit photographs to help us explain concepts and reassure people.', 'Sometimes, the only way to explain something clearly is to use quite graphic photographs. Some couples aren’t happy about seeing them, but realising what a broad range of genital sizes, sexual positions, sexual acts, options, and body shapes there is out there can help them feel better about themselves.', '5. We also use sex-ed charts and diagrams to help people get to grips with their partner’s anatomy.', 'Occasionally we might use 3D models as well. It’s hard to pleasure someone else if you’re not sure how their equipment works. A lot of men think the cervix is on the outside of the vagina, for example, which can cause quite a bit of confusion.', '6. We do a lot of work with older people.', 'A lot of retirement age couples find their sex life has been gradually dropping off for years, and worry they might never have sex again if they don’t fix it. We tend to give these couples exercises to help them reconnect, starting with holding hands and cuddling, then moving on to kissing and sexual touching.', '7. We also see a lot of couples whose sex lives have taken a dive after having kids.', 'Just because the doctor says it’s OK to have sex again six weeks after childbirth, that doesn’t mean things immediately snap back into place. A woman might find she’s too sore, or self-conscious, or both parents might simply be too tired. We often end up comforting new parents and reassuring them that the situation is normal.', '8. Lots of couples we work with have issues that can be solved with just a bit of communication.', 'Many couples can have sex but can’t bring themselves to talk about the details, i.e. what they enjoy most. This in turn can put people off sex, because they find it unsatisfying but they can’t face asking their partner to change their technique. Our sessions help people open up about what really gives them pleasure.', '9. Other clients have never explored their bodies, so they’re not sure what they do enjoy.', 'Masturbation and self-exploration (sometimes involving looking at your genitals in a mirror) can help you get to know your body and learn about what feels good for you. In turn, this will help you guide your partners to those sweet, sensitive spots.', '10. A sexless relationship is seen as a massive taboo.', 'But if both partners are comfortable with that, why should it be? It’s seen as the worst thing in the world, but some very loving relationships do end up being nonsexual for various reasons, and we can help people come to terms with this.', '11. Fifty Shades of Grey caused us lots of problems.', 'Suddenly couples were showing up in our offices, often upset because one partner had tried to act out their Fifty Shades fantasies and the other didn’t want to.

Unless you really want to, of course.', '16. Women often say they’re disappointed that they can’t orgasm the ""real"" way.', 'And by that, they mean penetrative intercourse. But the reality is that the clitoris and the opening of the vagina aren’t always positioned in a way that makes it possible, and a lot of women feel self-conscious pleasuring themselves during sex. We work hard to explain there’s no real, right, or (particularly) wrong way to do things.', '17. Men tend to present with problems about erections and ejaculation.', 'Porn makes it seem like every man has a massive dick and has no problem at all keeping an erection, lasting for hours in bed, and ejaculating at the end of it all. There’s also a feeling that you’re less of a man if you don’t perform as expected. We might end up referring some clients to a doctor if their problems are medical.', '18. And as women get older, dryness and related pain during sex can start to be an issue.', 'Again, this is perfectly normal and doesn’t mean you don’t find your partner attractive, or feel horny, but it can take a while to come to terms with these physical changes and understand what’s causing them. Thankfully, lube exists.', '19. Mismatched levels of desire are common too.', 'If one person in a relationship wants sex more than their partner, they often end up feeling very hurt whenever they’re turned down.

There’s a lot of pressure to have a ""perfect"" or generally amazing sex life.', 'There are so many strange ideas floating around about how much sex ""typical"" people should be having.

Which means the most common question we get asked is: ""Am I normal?""', 'Meaning ""Do I/we have a normal amount of sex?"" or ""Do I last for the normal amount of time?"" There’s an easy answer to this – nothing is normal! Instead of trying to fit in with what you’ve seen on TV, in magazines, or in porn films, explore what you want, what you enjoy, and what your specific desires are.', '22. Also, your genitals are perfectly OK, honestly.', 'A lot of clients feel self conscious about their vagina or penis and decide it looks ""weird"", especially compared to porn. We have diagrams, drawings, and photos that show how vastly different people’s hoo-hahs and willies are, which helps.', '23. Laughter and sex don’t have to be incompatible.', 'Once sex starts to become ""serious"" or ""an issue"", i.e. something you’re going to therapy for, it feels more pressured. Laughter can help diffuse that tension and get things back on track. Sex games, roleplay, and toys are fantastic ways to start, but don’t take it too far and dress as a clown (unless you really want to).', '24.

I surveyed decades of studies on the psychological effects of having a child to write my book ""Great Myths of Intimate Relationships: Dating, Sex, and Marriage,"" and here’s what the research literature shows.', 'Nowhere To Go But Down?', ""When people marry, they’re usually in love and happy to be tying the knot. But after that, things tend to change. On average, couples' satisfaction with their marriage declines during the first years of marriage and, if the decline is particularly steep, divorce may follow. The course of true love runs downhill. And that’s before you factor in what happens when it’s time to start buying a carseat and diapers."", 'For around 30 years, researchers have studied how having children affects a marriage, and the results are conclusive: the relationship between spouses suffers once kids come along. Comparing couples with and without children, researchers found that the rate of the decline in relationship satisfaction is nearly twice as steep for couples who have children than for childless couples. In the event that a pregnancy is unplanned, the parents experience even greater negative impacts on their relationship.', 'The irony is that even as the marital satisfaction of new parents declines, the likelihood of them divorcing also declines. So, having children may make you miserable, but you’ll be miserable together.', 'Worse still, this decrease in marital satisfaction likely leads to a change in general happiness, because the biggest predictor of overall life satisfaction is one’s satisfaction with their spouse.', 'While the negative marital impact of becoming parents is familiar to fathers and mothers, it is especially insidious because so many young couples think that having children will bring them closer together or at least will not lead to marital distress. Yet, this belief, that having children will improve one’s marriage, is a tenacious and persistent myth among those who are young and in love.', 'Lovers Morph Into Parents', 'It seems obvious that adding a baby to a household is going to change its dynamics. And indeed, the arrival of children changes how couples interact. Parents often become more distant and businesslike with each other as they attend to the details of parenting. Mundane basics like keeping kids fed, bathed and clothed take energy, time and resolve. In the effort to keep the family running smoothly, parents discuss carpool pickups and grocery runs, instead of sharing the latest gossip or their thoughts on presidential elections. Questions about one’s day are replaced with questions about whether this diaper looks full.', 'These changes can be profound. Fundamental identities may shift – from wife to mother, or, at a more intimate level, from lovers to parents. Even in same-sex couples, the arrival of children predicts less relationship satisfaction and sex. Beyond sexual intimacy, new parents tend to stop saying and doing the little things that please their spouses. Flirty texts are replaced with messages that read like a grocery receipt.', 'With nearly half of all births being to unmarried couples, some parents may think they have gamed the system by skipping the wedding. Not so. The relationship burden of having children is present regardless of marital status, gender orientation or level of income. In addition, the adverse impact of becoming a parent is found in other countries, including those with greater rates of nonmarital parenting and more generous family policies.', 'Moms Bear The Brunt', 'Not surprisingly, it is mothers, not fathers, who bear the heaviest cost of becoming parents. Even when both parents work outside the home and even in marriages in which both spouses describe themselves as sharing the burden of household chores, most parents slide toward gender-stereotypical ways of parenting. Women are more likely to become the ""on call"" parent, the one who gets up in the night to bring a child a tissue or who’s called by the school nurse.', 'As part of this pattern, new mothers tend to cut their hours in outside work, which often leads fathers to feel more of the burden of financial responsibility. A common pattern emerges in which dads start spending more time and energy on outside work and moms start doing an increasing percentage of the childcare and housework. Cue the feelings of frustration, guilt and distress for both parents.', ""New mothers often talk about their social isolation, becoming disconnected from friends and colleagues and how their world feels like it’s shrinking. All of these changes lead to fundamental and long-lasting effects on new mothers' circle of support, including with their spouses."", 'The consequences of the relationship strain can be serious. Marital stress is associated with many serious physical health problems as well as symptoms of depression and other mental health problems. The link between psychological and marital problems is strong enough that researchers have found that couples therapy is one of the most effective ways of treating depression and some other mental illnesses.', 'A Light At The End Of The Tunnel?', 'If the arrival of children is hard on marriages, is the departure of children good for marriages? Some marriages do improve once the children leave the nest. In other cases, the successful launch of the children leads spouses to discover they have few shared interests and there’s nothing keeping them together.', 'These downsides to having children may partly explain why more and more women in the United States and around the world are choosing not to procreate. According to the U.S. Census, the percent of childless American women (ages 15-44) increased a staggering amount in just two generations: from 35 percent in 1976 to 47 percent in 2010.', 'Despite the dismal picture of motherhood painted by researchers like me (sorry Mom), most mothers (and fathers) rate parenting as their greatest joy. Much like childbirth, where nearly all mothers believe the pain and suffering was worth it, most mothers believe the rewards of watching their children grow up is worth the cost to their romantic relationships.']",1

However, unlike every other such person, Fischer decided to contribute to this conversation by doubling the depth of modern historical data about them.', 'Until now, the most commonly cited information about SF housing prices had gone back to 1979, when the city started tracking the ""median rent of two-bedroom apartments advertised in the San Francisco Chronicle on one Sunday per year.""', 'Unfortunately for this data, 1979 also happens to be the year that San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein imposed a rent freeze that transitioned into rent control.

Here’s how Fischer summarizes a scenario in which, his formula suggests, apartment prices would drop 67 percent:', 'It would take a 53% increase in the housing supply (200,000 new units), or a 44% drop in CPI-adjusted salaries, or a 51% drop in employment, to cut prices by two thirds.', 'OK, so this would mean the way to make San Francisco as affordable as (say) Portland would be to either cut everybody’s salary in half, or fire half of them, or rapidly increase the number of homes by 50 percent, which would let the population rapidly leap to about 1.2 million.', 'Shit.', 'But wait, you might be saying. Prague has about 1.2 million residents. Milan has about 1.2 million residents. Those are nice cities. It would actually be fine if San Francisco turned into Prague, especially if the prices went down by two-thirds.', 'That’s probably true. The problem is that rapidly turning into Prague would require thousands of developers to go bankrupt, because (remember?) rents would drop by 67 percent so all those developers would not be able to pay off the loans they took out to build those 200,000 new homes.', 'Come to think of it, thousands of bankrupt developers may not sound too bad to you, either. But believe me, it sounds bad to the developers. Which is why there could never be a situation where private developers would add that many new homes at once — they would stop building long before that return to paradise could happen.', 'The way I see it, this leaves us with a few interesting lessons for San Francisco:', 'Adding new units is mostly only going to keep shit from getting worse.', '1a. That’s still a good thing.', '2. Rent control does not seem to be a huge cause of the problem per se. Shit was bad before; shit was bad after; shit did not get notably better or worse for the median apartment seeker, at least if you start in 1956. (On the other hand, something odd is going on in Fischer’s early price data from the 40s. If you omit the 1950–1960 dip in rents, then everything before rent control in 1979 starts looking more like a plateau. Here’s his first chart again for good measure.)', '2a. The way that rent control might matter indirectly is if it leads indirectly to fewer new units, for example because it gives people a reason to protest or sue to prevent developers from replacing little old rent-controlled buildings with big new market-rate ones. Which is pretty understandable on the part of the poor people but it’s still a shitty outcome, because (as Fischer’s formula suggests) every fancy new roof holds prices down a little bit because the rich people under it don’t push middle-class people out from under their middle-quality roofs, and so on down the line until someone ends up in a tent.', '2b. Still, there’s no clear sign in this data that rent control has had this additional anti-new-housing effect on San Francisco. Again: shit was bad before. Shit was bad after.', '3. Cutting infill development costs would help if there are ways to do that without screwing other things up too much.', '4. If there is something stopping the housing market from building enough new homes for newcomers, then it’s probably got to be something that arrived around 1960 or earlier.', 'I’m going to stop talking about San Francisco at this point, because San Francisco depresses me. Basically, I think San Francisco is fucked.', 'That sucks. It’s an amazing place.', 'Instead, I’m going to close with a lesson for cities that are adding jobs and/or wealth faster than homes but are not yet San Francisco: Portland, Seattle, Austin, Denver, Minneapolis.

So maybe try doing townhouses if you can. Townhouses are great. Cliff and Claire Huxtable lived in a townhouse. Duplexes are nice too. A lot of cities have actually made it illegal to build either of these. That is nuts.', 'Taxes to create public or other subsidized housing? The poorest people will never be able to afford market-rate housing, and people in cheap but livable little homes tend to get into much less trouble than people in tents.

"['How to get that song out of your head, according to science']","['Are you imagining music in your head? If so, it’s probably a certain Kylie Minogue hit. Sorry. But hopefully, once you’ve read this, you’ll be in a better position than you were before to get rid of it, or any other imaginary music playing on repeat in your mind’s ear.', ""Research suggests that 'earworms' – that experience of having music stuck in your head – are commonplace. It also suggests, contrary to popular belief, that most of the time earworms are not particularly troublesome. But I’m not alone in sometimes seeking to silence those silent songs. So here are six tips for earworm eradication based on the latest research."", '1. Shut your ears', ""First of all, avoid music. This is certainly easier said than done – and, as a musician, not something I would seriously recommend. That being said, I’m careful to avoid hearing any music before going to bed, since its transformation into an earworm interferes with my sleep. Repetition and recency are the dreaded 'Rs'of earworm sufferers."", 'Try not to listen to a song over and over again, and avoid music that is in itself highly repetitive. We also know that having heard a song recently is the most cited reason for then imagining it. If you’d rather that a different song played from your mental jukebox, make sure that this is the last thing that you hear.', 'There is also some evidence that if the music we are listening to is interrupted, we continue it mentally (known as the Zeigarnik effect). To prevent this from happening, it’s advisable to listen through to the end of the track.', '2. Physical remedies', 'But should these earworm prevention tips have failed, how can we get rid of intrusive musical thoughts?', 'A recent research paper claims that chewing gum provides a simple solution. In a series of experiments, participants who were given gum to chew reported fewer earworms than those who weren’t. Normally, our vocal apparatus is involved in singing, so the theory goes that when our jaws are otherwise engaged, our ability to imagine music is impaired.', 'Another tip to foil your earworm is to walk at a much faster or slower pace than the song’s beat. It seems that we form relatively accurate memories for the tempo of familiar music.', 'We also know that movement (for example dancing, tapping, nodding along) is an important contributor to earworm experience. By using body movement to disturb our memory for the musical tempo, we can interrupt the musical flow to end the seemingly automatic mental replay.', '3. Sing', 'A popular way to engage with music is to sing it. Research suggests that if you’re prone to everyday singing, you’re also prone to earworms that last for a relatively long time. Why not turn this to your advantage and make an active choice to serenade those around you with music that would provide a positive mental accompaniment to your day?', 'When that unwanted earworm starts, sing something else, out loud. Singing the theme to 80 Days Around the World, the cartoon from the 1980s, used to be my personal antidote, but now I’m more selective in my musical choices.', '4. Listen to your mood', 'One of the factors shaping my choice of music to imagine is my mood. An extensive survey of earworm reports points to the importance of mood, stress and emotional state in the occurrence of earworms.', 'There is also some evidence that when we imagine a particular song, our mood approximates the way we felt when we heard it. So if you were angry when you heard Justin Bieber on the radio this morning, you might feel angry when it’s circling your brain later in the day.', 'More psychological research is needed to understand whether we deliberately imagine music to regulate our emotions. In the meantime, if the mood evoked by the music in your head does not correspond to your desired emotional state, change the (mental) record.', '5. Phone a friend', 'To eradicate earworms altogether, consider doing a mental activity that is either more or less challenging. We know that routine activities which are low in cognitive load, such as tooth brushing, are conducive to mind wandering, which can, in turn, lead to involuntary musical imagery. On the other hand, mentally demanding tasks such as difficult homework have also been associated with earworms.', 'But mind wandering rarely occurs when we socialise; an activity that lies in the middle of the range for its mental challenge. A potentially pleasant way to banish unwanted musical thoughts could be to spend time with friends.', '6. Don’t try so hard', 'It would be remiss of me not to warn you of the irony that attempts to deliberately control our thoughts have been known to have the opposite effect. Interestingly, differences in how much we want to suppress earworms appear to be reflected in the cortical structures of our brain.', 'If your earworms have resisted all deliberate attempts to banish them, my final advice is to stop trying and to distract yourself. Some people find musical or verbal distractions such as watching TV to be particularly effective if you have the leisure. I should be so lucky.

"[""10 New Year's resolutions for your wallet""]","[""Love or hate New Year's resolutions, there probably are a few you could stand to make for your wallet's sake. They can be short-term, easy fixes to save money throughout the year, while also potentially helping you achieve larger financial goals."", 'Here are my 10 suggestions to make sure you start off 2017 on the right financial footing:', ""1. Clean out your wallet. A cluttered wallet isn't just bulky; it also can be expensive if you're paying for cards you don't use. Start lean and mean in 2017. Review the cards and figure out how they benefit you. Many people, myself included, signed up for some cards merely for their cool factor or maybe to pursue a one-time benefit   such as a juicy sign-up bonus that has long since been exhausted. At best, these cards can be a distraction and waste of space. At worst, they can cost you an annual fee without making up for it in benefits. Keep only cards earning high rewards that you'll actually use or cards that are important to maintain your credit score."", ""2. Prioritize your purchases. Healthy budgeting may sound about as fun as healthy dieting, but success for both often can start with something as simple as understanding what works best for you. At its heart, a budget helps you recognize trade-offs in your purchases. Movies or dining out? Game console or summer vacation? New clothes or weekend getaway? Until you're able to identify and plan for these trade-offs in advance, you're not in charge of your money."", ""3. Optimize your credit cards. Whether you're trying to maximize rewards or minimize the cost of credit card debt, you probably have room for improvement. At this point, 1.5% cash back is the new gold standard for rewards, so make sure you're earning at least that much on every purchase. And if you're looking to minimize the cost of debt, a 12-month, 0% intro APR offer is a good baseline. If you're unsure what kind of card you might qualify for, I recommend checking your free credit score or seeing whether you pre-qualify for a card."", ""4. Upgrade your checking account. As I emphasized a couple of columns ago, bank fees bite. If you're paying fees for your checking account regularly, that's a sign you could be doing better   either with your own money management or your choice in banks. A new account might also come with new capabilities such as mobile check deposit or better ATM access. Here's a handy guide to find the right checking account for you."", ""5. Upgrade your savings account. There's a fair chance you could be earning higher interest in the coming new year than you did in 2016. Many online banks are offering annual percentage yields of 1% or higher, which we hope will rise since the Federal Reserve increased its funds rates in December."", ""6. Open a P2P account. Still writing and receiving physical checks to and from friends and family? What a hassle. It's nearly 2017, not 1987. If you need to pay someone back quickly and easily   whether for baby-sitting, splitting utility bills or sharing a restaurant tab   open an account on a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app such as Venmo, PayPal, Zelle or Square Cash. Ask around to see what's popular among your friends, as they'll need to use the same app to receive or send money."", ""7. Boost your savings rate. Saving money can be hard, especially if it's for a less-immediate goal such as retirement, an emergency fund (see below) or a down payment on a home. Here are tips to boost your savings rate: (1) If your employer matches 401(k) contributions, make sure you're contributing enough from your paycheck to get the full match. (2) Divert some of your wages automatically into your savings account before you have the chance to spend it. (3) Plan now to save any windfalls, such as tax refunds, gifts or the occasional lottery winnings. (4) Check your credit card and checking account statements to see whether you can cut any charges for recurring services that aren't needed."", ""8. Build an emergency fund. A key measure of financial freedom is the ability to cover short-term emergencies with cash instead of by taking on debt. That said, many of us already have plenty of debt, and it's often difficult to decide between saving cash or paying down that debt. The short story? All things being equal, putting a little money in the bank generally should be prioritized in most cases."", ""9. Use your rewards card for every purchase. Sure, credit card rewards rates won't make you rich, but the 1.5% you could earn back on every purchase adds up. It can help boost your savings or make a significant dent in a planned purchase."", ""10. Use your airline miles. Airlines historically devalue points on their loyalty programs every few years, and you'll also want to make sure there's no expiration policy on your points or miles. Saving them for some big future vacation might sound nice, but if they need to be redeemed by a certain point, don't let them slip through your fingers.""]",1

"[""Our readers' picks for the 10 best Phish songs of all time has very surprising Number 1""]","['""You Enjoy Myself,"" ""Fluffhead"" and your surprise pick for Number One', ""To celebrate the release of Fuego, Phish's new studio album, we recently asked self-identifying Phans to dig into the hundreds upon hundreds of songs in the Vermont jam band's playbook and tell us their favorites. We learned that this group aligns themselves with Phish's greatest live epics, their one stab at Top 40 radio and surprisingly, one song that hasn't been heard in nearly 30 years. Click through to see 10 most popular tunes."", '10. ""Farmhouse""', 'Easily the most radio friendly track in the Phish catalog, ""Farmhouse"" is to the Vermont band what ""Touch of Grey"" once was to the Grateful Dead: that accessible cut that\'s universally loved by both diehard and the casual fans. Written and recorded in – what else – a barn, the track\'s melody borrows so heavily from Bob Marley\'s ""No Woman, No Cry"" that frontman Trey Anastasio alludes to the reggae classic with the line ""in the farmhouse, things will be all right.""', '9. ""Run Like an Antelope""', 'This Lawn Boy epic starts quietly before kicking into cacophonous high gear. There\'s a reason fans crave this song: ""Run Like an Antelope"" often finds Phish at their most playful and theatrical, and the ""happen to have any spliff, man?"" line still gets roars from audiences that surely do. The song\'s tension-and-release is unrelenting but eventually arrives at the titular mantra, ""Set the gearshift for the high gear of your soul. You’ve got to run like an antelope, out of control.""', '8. ""The Lizards""', 'One of only two songs in this poll that wasn\'t featured on either a studio album or major label live LP, ""The Lizards"" is also the lone representative from Anastasio\'s concept album, The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday. Although much of Phish\'s catalog and live identity is informed by the Grateful Dead, ""The Lizards"" is one of those tracks where the prog-rock influence of King Crimson and early Genesis successfully seeped into the band\'s music, right down to its extraordinary outro.', '7. ""Fluffhead""', 'Another epic from Phish\'s Junta early years, the ""Bohemian Rhapsody""-esque ""Fluffhead"" is comprised of six, tightly executed parts: ""Fluff\'s Travels,"" ""The Chase,"" ""Who Do? We Do,"" ""Clod,"" ""Bundle of Joy"" and ""Arrival."" While jamming is Phish\'s expertise, the difficult arrangements on ""Fluffhead"" don\'t allow much room to maneuver, so performances of this track are usually pretty uniform. ""Fluffhead"" is so challenging that the band actually avoided it for a stretch. Thankfully, it has remained a concert regular for the past decade.', '6. ""Harry Hood""', 'A fan favorite sing-along and the highlight of any concert where it\'s played, this reggae-flavored track finds Phish building and building in waves that slowly ascend over the course of its usual 15-minute runtime. Eventually, it climaxes with a ""You could feel good about Hood"" chant, referring to a cartoon spokesperson for the Hood Dairy Company. ""Harry Hood"" is also often the canvas in which Chris Kuroda, the band\'s longtime light board operator and so-called fifth member, does his best work, using the song\'s crescendos to deliver a full-on visual assault.', '5. ""Reba""', 'In his list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time, Fricke wrote that Trey Anastasio\'s playing style features ""Frank Zappa\'s impish inclination toward noise."" ""Reba,"" then, is Phish at their most Zappa. It\'s easy to imagine the Mothers of Invention singing the comical, tongue-in-cheek lyrics that open the song, which then transforms into Phish\'s version of Zappa\'s ""RDNZL,"" a bouncy composition followed by what is routinely one of the most mind-blowing guitar solos in the Anastasio arsenal. After the solo peaks, phans are treated to some cool-down whistling before ""Reba"" returns to its addictive chorus.', '4. ""Tweezer""', 'Even though the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous (""Won\'t you step into the freezer, tease her with a tweezer""), audiences love this cut because each performance is a journey into the unknown: ""Tweezer"" can last 10 minutes or it can consume an entire set (see 5/7/94, dubbed ""Tweezerfest"")', 'it can be a standalone song or it can segue into just about anything. ""Tweezer"" has always been unpredictable and that\'s why it remains the centerpiece and highlight of any Phish show it invades. Added bonus: A performance of ""Tweezer Reprise"" is always waiting in the wings.', '3. ""Divided Sky""', 'Often deemed Phish\'s masterpiece, this is another track that dates back to Trey Anastasio\'s days as a music student at Goddard College. Light on lyrics – an a caPpella ""Divided sky, the wind blows high"" is all the vocal work necessary for this 15-minute track – ""Divided Sky"" boasts some of the most intricate and melodic sections in the entire Phishography. While a studio version appears on 1989\'s Junta, it\'s in the live setting that ""Divided Sky"" really flourishes, with Anastasio taking his guitar solo to skyscraping levels.', '2. ""You Enjoy Myself""', 'The most played Phish song ever – Phish.net counts 563 shows – ""You Enjoy Myself"" is a favorite for both phans and Phish themselves. Again, the lyrics are simple and ridiculous – ""Boy! Man! God! Shit! Wash Uffizi drive me to Firenze"" – but they\'re countered by the complexity of the arrangements. While ""Y.E.M."" was recorded in the studio for 1989\'s Junta, the A Live One rendition has become the iconic and perhaps definitive version of this track. ""You Enjoy Myself"" was also the lone Phish song to land on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs.', '1. ""Lushington""', 'We think this is Phish phans phucking with us. In Phish\'s nearly three-decade history, ""Lushington"" has only been played eight times, and it\'s been shelved since 1987. While elements of the song ended up in ""Fluffhead,"" ""Lushington"" is the great white whale of Phish cuts, and given the fact it won this poll thanks to some major league ballot stuffing, it’s the track fans are most clamoring to hear live. With any luck, Trey and the boys see the results of the Readers\' Poll, see how in demand the song is and bust it out on their coming tour. We wouldn\'t hold our breaths, though.']",1

Over two decades later, Disney is aiming to replicate that magic and then some with its live action remake next year. Among the actors who are participating in this retelling is Harry Potter star Emma Watson, who will play the lead protagonist, Belle. We\'ve barely seen anything of what her take on the character will be like, but Broadway star Paige O\'Hara, the actress who voiced Belle in the original animated movie, thinks Watson is perfect for the role. O\'Hara sat down with USA Today to talk about Beauty and the Beast for its 25th anniversary Blu-ray release, and when asked what she thought of Emma Watson playing Belle in the live action remake, she had nothing but kind words. As she put it: I think that if I were producing that movie, Emma Watson would\'ve been my first choice for Belle. I was just really happy they went with Emma. She\'s got the intelligence, she\'s got the humor. I think she\'s going to be really, really special. It should be noted that Paige O\'Hara nor her animated movie costars at the interview Robby Benson and Richard White, who voiced the Beast and Gaston, respectively, have met the actors playing the live action versions of their characters. However, they\'re definitely comfortable with ""passing the torch"" to these other performers, and all three complimented how the teaser trailer looked. O\'Hara stayed involved with Beauty and the Beast long after the first movie was released, voicing Belle in various projects until 2011. Obviously Belle is important to her, so it\'s good to hear that she has high hopes for Emma Watson\'s performance. I was briefly worried she held a deep hatred for all Hogwarts alumni. Just like its animated predecessor, the new Beauty and the Beast will follow Belle, a young girl who is taken prisoner by the Beast in his castle. Despite her initial horror at his monstrous appearance, she eventually gets to know him and the other enchanted denizens. As Belle and the Beast fall in love, they\'ll have to contend with Gaston, a hunter from Belle\'s town who is eager to slay Beast and take Belle for himself. Along with Emma Watson, the remake\'s cast includes Dan Stevens at The Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, Josh Gad as LeFou and Stanley Tucci as Cadenza. You can see Emma Watson as the new Belle when the live action Beauty and the Beast movie hits theaters on March 17, 2017.

But I realized that these sugar hits always led to a crash -- and then a craving for even more -- which made it clear to me that it was time to make a change."", 'Your Brain on Sugar', 'Sugar acts within the brain\'s ""Reward Center"" mechanism (it\'s like the brain\'s equivalent of the elementary school Gold Star chart, or if you\'re like me and in a home with a toddler right now, the ""Potty Chart""). Upon eating sugar, your brain releases Dopamine, our favorite ""feel good"" hormone, the same one that\'s triggered by other pleasure mechanisms like sex, exercise, and, on the bad side of the spectrum, drugs like cocaine or meth.', 'Through the same mechanisms as drug addiction, frequent sugar intake means that the brain eventually gets accustomed to that high and become less sensitive to sugar. So to get the same rush, your brain requires more and more sugar over time.', 'Here\'s how it works: You eat a sugary food, your blood sugar levels spike, and your body releases Dopamine (yay!) and insulin (which triggers your body to store the sugar as fat). Then comes the ""crash"": your sugar level plummets and you feel tired, hungry, and reach for the next sugary treat. It\'s purely chemistry, my dear, and these physical urges completely override your willpower and desire to eat healthfully.', 'Break the Sugar Cycle', 'So are you doomed to be a victim to brain chemistry?

The FDA just acknowledged the confusion behind these labels this week and is looking at redefining them, but until then, it\'s fair game for sugar-ladened snacks to boast the ""healthy"" designation.', '(2) It\'s sneaky: Sugar exists in many forms, making it easy for the food industry to hide it in ingredient lists, listed with other names in foods you might not even think of as ""sugary.""', ""The Let's-Be-Realistic Bottom Line"", ""Look, we all know the white stuff is going to sneak in somewhere, sometime, into our own and our kids' diets.

I may be a science nerd at times, but even I don\'t expect you to memorize them. Here are a few tricks: avoid anything ending in ""-ose"" like sucrose or maltrose. Look out for the buzzwords of ""syrup,"" ""nectar,"" ""cane"" and ""sweetener."" And be mindful that even natural sugars, like agave or honey, still contribute to your daily sugar limit.

News flash -- your brain doesn't even recognize these calories as food, leading to a high and crash that will end with you eating even more.

For the most part, unless you\'re talking a fresh-pressed, unsweetened juice, you\'re better off eating a whole piece of fruit. And to settle the whole fruit-is-sugar debate, while fruit does have sugar in the form of fructose, it\'s nothing in comparison to added sugars and doesn\'t cause the same blood-spiking mechanisms. There\'s no need to limit fruit if you\'re focusing on cutting back added sugar.', 'DIY It:', ""You don't have to completely cut out everything sweet; I don't like my coffee black or my yogurt plain. But it's a lot easier to control the amount of sugar you're adding if you do it yourself. Add a half-packet to coffee instead of letting the barista talk you into a fancy sweetened frappe. Buy plain Greek yogurt and add berries and honey; I guarantee it will have less sugar than the fruit-flavored, sugar-laden packaged kind.

Only the worthy may pass."" This week, a player named Kharsek passed through that door. It took him nine years to build up enough experience to hit level 999. But once he passed through the door, Kharsek disappeared, and took the secrets with him.', 'This mysterious door has been one of Tibia\'s more reclusive secrets since it was added into the game in 2005. For a long time, the developers told me, there was nothing behind the door. It was a joke shared with the community, an amusing ""what if?"" meant to remain unsolved.', '""The main motivation clearly was to tease players because the creators honestly did not think that anyone would actually reach that level,"" said Tibia lead project manager Martin Eglseder.', 'Then, one person did.', 'This is the door that people have been wondering about for a decade.', ""Tibia, one of the oldest MMOs on the internet, launched in 1997. Nearly 20 years later, people are still actively playing it. As of this writing, there are 12,701 people playing Tibia. It's never been a game for the timid; Tibia is a hardcore online RPG, one that regularly kicks players in the teeth. When you die, the game docks a percentage of experience from your character, potentially rolling back real-world days worth of progress. That edge is what keeps people coming back."", '""The combination of the extremely harsh death penalty and the hardcore leveling curve is what makes the game fun,"" said Mathias Bynens, the owner of TibiaMaps, a blog chronicling the ongoing changes made to the world of Tibia. ""It makes gaining another level feel like an accomplishment and successfully escaping from a dangerous situation feel like a relief.""', ""Tibia started as a hobbyist project by four German computer-science students.

They are Tibians.""', ""Tibians are often obsessed with knowing everything about the game. A true secret is hard to find. That's what makes the locked door so alluring: For once, everybody is truly in the dark."", ""There is no level cap in Tibia. If players truly wanted to, they could level forever. But the reason a door demanding a player reach level 999 was so daunting is because leveling up in Tibia, especially as you reach into the hundreds, is a draining and time-consuming task. That didn't stop Kharsek, who first joined the game in 2007. He's the first player to reach level 999."", '""That Kharsek reached level 999 is impressive,"" said Bynens.

Going from level 19 to level 20 requires 15,400 experience points, and the most you can get from a single enemy is a high-level boss that drops 35,000 XP. For level 49 to level 50, it's 112,900 XP. At level 50, you've acquired a grand total of 1,847,300 XP. At level 100, it's a massive 15,694,800 XP."", 'Moving from level 998 to level 999, though?

The closest player to Kharsek is 60 levels behind.', 'Even with a team of people helping him with buffing, healing, and other tactics, Bynens estimates Kharsek was earning roughly 5 million XP per hour. At that pace, it would take roughly nine hours of constant grinding simply to move from level 998 to level 999.', ""And he's not the only one who's been keeping tabs on Kharsek. His level progression has been closely monitored and celebrated, as the milestones stacked, with videos shared on YouTube."", 'Eight months ago, Kharsek was only on level 930. Three months ago, he was on level 968. And remember, any time that Kharsek was killed would send him spiraling back down in levels, taking him further away from his goal.', 'The level 999 door has vexed Tibia players for years, but it drew wider awareness when a Reddit post predicted Kharsek would soon reach level 999, drawing interest to a fever pitch.', '""I\'ve never heard of this game in my life,"" said one commenter, ""and the most important thing I have right now is this stupid bastard opening that stupid door.""', 'The developers have been preparing for this moment, long before Kharsek hit level 999.', '""I\'ve never heard of this game in my life, and the most important thing I have right now is this stupid bastard opening that stupid door."" -Reddit comment', '""A secret that has existed and been nourished by players for so many years cannot be lifted without disappointment,"" said Eglseder. ""You cannot fulfill all the different hopes and expectations that players have attached to it. No matter what you do, you cannot satisfy everybody.""', 'In terms of deciding what would actually be beyond the door, they went with something they feel is ""best for the game as a whole and in the long run.""', ""In today's streaming culture, it wouldn't have been a surprise if Kharsek made a big deal about walking through the door. He could have built up the spectacle and drawn attention to himself. But that's not what happened. Instead, earlier this week, Kharsek did what no other player in Tibia has done before and quietly walked through the door that demanded a player be level 999."", ""... And that was it. The outside world hasn't heard from Kharsek since. It's been radio silence."", '""Maybe there are chests with rewards inside there,"" reads a forum post by a player that watched as Kharsek walked through the level 999 door. ""Maybe there are NPCs there... Maybe levers and hidden stuff... We don\'t know... Kharsek got out... and logged off.""', ""As of today, no one knows what's behind the door. The developers are keeping quiet, too."", '""No, we won\'t spoil what\'s behind [the door],"" said Eglseder. ""We could verify this, but we leave it up to the player to tell whatever he wants to share about the door and the secret behind [it].""', 'The most Eglseder would say, perhaps to calm players worried they\'re missing something amazing, is ""there\'s not a whole feature set or package of \'end game\' content behind it.""', 'Or is there?', 'It seems possible that Kharsek was upset about the way Tibia players have been treating him. On his quest to level 999, people would track him down and screw with his leveling progress.', '""A group of people liked to consistently invade the spawns Kharsek was hunting in and kill as many creatures as possible, just to lower his exp/hour rate,"" said Bynens. ""Other times they\'d lure hordes of strong creatures on Kharsek\'s healers, forcing them to run away or die, causing Kharsek to be left without a healer, which is dangerous even at his level. Bullying at its worst. I don\'t know what Kharsek did to deserve this. Maybe people just got jealous at his high level?""', ""And now, there's another reason to be jealous: Kharsek is the only one who knows what's behind that door.""]",1

""It was a frustrating game there was no doubt about that, to go out this way. Again, the high note to start this series, the way we got out to a 2-0 lead, we couldn\'t finish it off.

['California Just Made Climate Change History. How Did it Happen?'],"['The day before yesterday I sat in the gallery of the California Senate and saw something that just a few weeks ago I wasn’t expecting: Senators casting the final vote on an historic set of bills—Senate Bill 32 (Pavley) and Assembly Bill 197 (E. Garcia)—that reaffirm the state’s commitment to addressing climate change through 2030. After the vote was over, my colleagues and I shared hugs, smiles, and tears as the weight of the accomplishment washed over us. It was a great day.', 'There will be a time for a more thorough examination of how we achieved this victory, but here is my quick take of what just happened.', 'A referendum on California’s climate change policies', 'Followers of California climate change policy know that ten years ago, the state adopted a first-in-the-nation law to comprehensively tackle global warming by mandating a statewide reduction in heat-trapping pollution. That law, AB 32, requires that by 2020 statewide emissions be reduced to the equivalent of emissions in 1990. Fast forward to 2016, and we see that this policy has been an overwhelming success.', 'Success aside, 2020 is fast approaching. So last year Governor Jerry Brown issued an Executive Order that established 2030 climate targets. However, the Governor’s action does not have the same weight or force of law as a legislative requirement. In addition, most observers recognized that a commitment of this significance ought to have the blessing of California’s legislature, and legislators rightly wanted to have their say.', 'Enter SB 32 and AB 197. SB 32 is simultaneously simple and sweeping. The bill codifies Governor Brown’s executive order by requiring heat-trapping emissions to be reduced to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Meanwhile, AB 197 takes steps to refine California’s climate change programs in two ways: it increases legislative oversight over and transparency to the state’s climate change programs and it emphasizes the state’s commitment to ensuring these policies help communities most impacted by climate change and air pollution. The two measures were double-joined, which meant that if one bill failed to pass the other could not go into effect.', 'Together these two bills became a referendum on California’s existing climate change programs. Passage would cement California’s commitment to leading the fight against global warming, while failure would have sent the message that California’s political leaders were divided on the issue.', 'A come-from-behind victory', 'In early August the conventional wisdom was that these bills were doomed to fail in 2016. Most people thought that the oil industry was too strong of a political opponent, and that a majority of legislators lacked the urgency to act. But, you just never know... So UCS, along with numerous other dedicated advocates, simply kept working. Over the last month we collectively turned up the heat and showed how much support there is for seriously addressing climate change in California.', 'Legislators heard from a diverse set of stakeholders who care deeply about the risks of global warming and the rewards of a clean energy economy. This included clean energy businesses, social justice advocates, environmentalists, labor leaders, faith-based organizations, public health advocates, consumer groups, and, yes, scientists. And, slowly, momentum started to build.', 'Legislators also saw that the voting public is hungry for meaningful action to address global warming. In late July there had been a Public Policy Institute of California poll showing that more than two-thirds of Californians support setting strong climate reduction goals for 2030. Tapping into this groundswell of support, UCS helped more than 4,000 Californians contact their legislators in the last month in support of SB 32 and AB 197, with other organizations doing the same. And the momentum kept building.', 'Soon major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Fresno Bee, and San Francisco Chronicle, weighed in as well to urge legislative action this year. Our coalition of supporters kept meeting with legislators. Constituents kept emailing and phoning in. And the momentum built even more.', 'While there is no easy answer to what proved to be the difference-maker in this campaign, it is undeniable that this victory would have been impossible without the tremendous leadership of Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, Senate President pro Tem Kevin de León, Assembly Member Eduardo Garcia, and Senator Fran Pavley. Together, along with other key lawmakers, they helped convince their colleagues that this was an important vote that ought to occur this year.', 'And I’m so glad they did. Thanks to the collective work of so many, California’s commitment to addressing climate change is stronger than ever. We have much work ahead of us to successfully deliver on these commitments in a way that protects our climate while also addressing the needs of Californians, who deserve greater investment in economic opportunities and a cleaner environment.', 'But for a few more days we will simply say, hip-hip hooray!', 'Posted in: Global Warming, Uncategorized Tags: AB 32, California, California Global Warming Solutions Act, climate-change, Global warming, SB 32', 'Support from UCS members make work like this possible. Will you join us? Help UCS advance independent science for a healthy environment and a safer world.']",1

You just have so much more to play with. I [also] love having a captive audience. You can actually tell a story and just sort of overwhelm them with this image and sound. You can change people\'s ideas and get people talking. And then actually making it –- I started making films that probably would only be seen in small rooms or in art galleries. I was working alone.

Before adolescence I had an incredible voice. Like when I was 12, 13, 14 -- I was taking acting classes, I was painting, I was making music, I was taking photographs. I was kind of exploding creatively, and then something about adolescence really just ground that out of me. By the time I hit college, my secret shame was the reason I was an actor was my own words sort of dried up. I stopped writing. I stopped being able to form my own vision. That's actually what my first feature is about -- looking back at two different selves."", ""There's an amazing organization in Seattle called Reel Grrls, and I just get chills whenever I go to a fundraiser or I read their newsletters or I go see their work. They are all about empowering adolescent girls to be able to deconstruct media that comes at them and tells them what they should look like and how they should feel about themselves and then empowers them with the technical skills to make media themselves. I often wonder if I'd been empowered with that kind of a program in my youth, would I have started making movies decades earlier?"", ""For me, I'm perfectly satisfied with the way that everything worked out because I feel I really paid my dues. There's this real deliciousness to being able to do exactly what you want to do and were meant to do after years of just sort of journeying toward that end. And who knows where I'd be now if I started making films early? Maybe I wouldn't have had as much to say. But I do think about that.

I've tried gyms and things -- I really hate them. And I can't run -- I have bad knees. So I have this little rebounder, this little trampoline. I just turn M.I.A. on and dance my butt off every morning. I noticed the mornings when I feel least like doing it are the mornings that I most need to. And I try to take at least one half-hour walk during the day. And in the edit room, I try to not just sit on the couch the whole time but stand up and pace around and I have another trampoline -- I'll sort of bounce on that.

So when I started making movies, he was 6. It was sort of perfect timing for me. My husband and I were trying to get pregnant, and I will admit that I was ambivalent. Because at the time we just didn\'t have a lot of money. And then I got the opportunity to make my first feature, and I said, ""OK, I\'m gonna put this on hold."" I was exhausted during my first pregnancy. Then as soon as I started making the film, it became really clear that every baby I had from now on was gonna be a movie. I was a really involved parent. We did attachment parenting. I mean, I nursed him till he was 3. We carried him around in a sling. It was very intense, and it was great. And I felt like if I wasn\'t able to do that with another kid, I would be cheating them somehow.

My kid had gone to the same school from preschool to eight grade. He’s hearing-impaired. And I told my producers months ago, ""This day is sacred. I have to be at this eight-grade graduation."" So we organized the whole shoot around having Friday night free. I’ve definitely missed stuff. There were things that impeded my ability to be at a school orientation, things like that. Now, after buying our house and putting me through grad school and really being the major breadwinner for the vast majority of our relationship, my husband and I have sort of switched off, and he’s become the full-time parent and I’m the breadwinner.

We seem to have divided up the bills somehow. Balancing the work-life thing is definitely something that took a few years to figure out. After this last shoot, we finally organized a family vacation. We all went away for a week, and it was the first time in years that we hadn’t just sort of tacked something on to a film festival or something. I felt like we were recharging the family batteries. But again, I’m in a relatively calm period now. So, you know, having dinner together every night, and we sort of trade off who does the cooking. I chip in whenever I’m able. I just don’t want him to feel like he’s the only one.', 'What would you title your autobiography?', ""Let's see.

"['Hey, here are some people who really, really should not run for president']","['March 2017 is probably far too early to start considering the next presidential election, and who the Democrats might send into the breach to take on Donald Trump (assuming he runs for re-election, of course). That said, there’s already an awful lot of rumor and sigh in the news transom about people having sudden-onset political stirrings, including those setting their sights on a 2020 presidential run.', 'Some of them are the last vestiges of the Clinton network, still high on that old Third Way supply, banking on the belief that the country isn’t yet done with late-1990s nostalgia. But a new group of would-be candidates is on the rise ― extravagantly wealthy wannabes stirred both by the Clinton-era Democratic Party embrace of meritocratic elites and the success of Trump’s outsider run. And if they all have something in common, it’s that they are all the worst possible people for the Democrats to run for office, if you consider the lessons of the 2016 election.', 'What were those lessons? Well, for one thing, 2016 was the year that the Democratic Party’s obsessions with the professional class finally caught up with it. Amid roaring calls for solutions to widely felt economic inequities, Hillary Clinton ran a campaign largely based on social niceties and boardroom diversification, with some incremental crumbs thrown the way of middle- and working-class strivers.', 'None of it added up to a compelling enough case against the GOP’s con-man class-traitor to win the election. (And tellingly, some taken-for-granted Democratic strongholds fell to Trump at the exact moment Democrats needed them most.) But if there’s one thing both political parties share, it’s that they are slow to learn their lessons. The fear that the Democrats might stay the course, despite Clinton’s failings, suffused the atmosphere in the recent Democratic National Committee election ― and those who wanted a decisive change are still not sure they’re getting one with the election of former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez. That some of the Clinton family’s most dedicated hangers-on feel like they are the person to run for office in the Trump era likely won’t soothe their ravaged souls, either.', 'And then there are the unfortunate side effects of Trump’s win itself, which has apparently touched off a whole new round of thinking as to whether it would be a good idea to examine this moment in history ― in which a brash billionaire-celebrity outsider has ascended to the highest political office in the world ― and consider whether the time is right to have more brash billionaire-celebrity outsiders try to run for president.', 'That every single day of the Trump presidency has been a scintillating demonstration of the Peter Principle seems to not deter anybody. Instead, the event of a complete and utter billionaire buffoon with no political experience has suggested to a slew of other buffoons that, hey, why not me?', 'A century or two of yawning inequality has left us with no shortage of such buffoons. Hundreds of these folks have ascended to the dizzying heights of our American oligarchy ― or were born there ― and now gaze downward, gripped with the firm conviction that they should run all that they see below. ""Stay in your lane,"" once the byword of America’s true and most successful innovators, is advice too easily chucked aside by today’s captains of industry. And so, ""meritocracy"" has become something of a dirty word.', 'Nowadays, those who have found success in one area are just as likely not to think that their success is translatable to other endeavors. When this turns out not to be the case, comical hijinks ensue. Perhaps the apotheosis of this rich-people folly came when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg thought it would be a good idea to appoint his friend, Hearst executive Cathleen Black, to the position of New York City schools chancellor ― despite the fact that her relevant experience could best be summed up as ""not any.""', 'It was a huge disaster, but did anyone learn a damn thing from this experience? (Hmmm, let me check: Oh, yeah, Betsy DeVos is the U.S. secretary of education. So, no, nobody did.)', 'Still it’s one thing for Republicans to consider running the play ― they’ve obviously managed to make it work, at least in the narrow electoral sense. And their billionaire was no obscure figure. Entering the election with 100-percent name identification, and a years-long run in American living rooms as a fictional, all-knowing business leader, gave Trump legs up that your random billionaire lacks.', 'Replicating either side of the last presidential election is a losing move for Democrats. But it’s a very tempting one: It’s a notion that allows the easy-breezy fantasy that a massive party overhaul isn’t necessary, and that all of their problems can be ameliorated by either billionaires with quick fixes and cash on-hand, or Clinton 2016-redux candidates with better data and marketing.', 'With that in mind, here are a bunch of people whose political ambitions should be extinguished with all deliberate haste.', 'Bob Iger: Who, pray tell, is Bob Iger? Well, for a while, he was a member of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, a collection of CEO heavyweights who were going to help Trump #MAGA, for which Iger was well suited as the chief executive of Walt Disney. SInce then, it’s been reported that he is mulling making a run for the White House in 2020. Hmmm, maybe he hasn’t thought through this whole politics thing? Apparently not, considering that his inspiration to maybe run for president stems from the fact that he says ""a lot of people ― a lot ― have urged me to seek political office."" I mean, maybe set your sights a little lower, first time out?', 'J.B. Pritzker: Having endeavored mightily to paint the past two Republican presidential nominees as out-of-touch wealthy elites ― and having failed to distinguish their own last presidential nominee as something different ― are Democrats stupid enough to make an about-face and run their own billionaire?No, J.B. Pritzker wouldn’t make it out of Iowa without a negative vote total. But even though he’s recently been sniffing around the possibility of running in the Illinois gubernatorial election, that hasn’t stopped him from floating to friends that he’s considering making a run for the White House as well ― or so we’re told by one recipient of such a flatulent flotation. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune, had designs on being commerce secretary under Hillary Clinton, just as his sister Penny Pritzker was under Obama. Just stop.', 'Sheryl Sandberg: According to some election-year rumors, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was in the running to serve as Hillary Clinton’s treasury secretary. Since then, she’s been rumored to be considering a White House run, amid occasional denials. At the same time, she has recently been more open to Trump’s overtures. She was one of those Silicon Valley leaders who met with Trump prior to the inauguration. As Slate’s Helaine Olen notes, Sandberg made no public mention of the Women’s March that took place afterwards, a curious move for the ""Lean In"" maven ― at least until you consider the fact that ""Lean In"" is a disingenuous brand-washing scheme, and that Sandberg is especially unwilling to criticize her C-suite peers for crimes against women in the workforce.', 'Howard Schultz: The Starbucks CEO has said ""never say never"" to a presidential run. Indeed, Schultz would be the fever-dream candidate of the No Labels set: his political ""brand,"" insofar as he has one, is essentially based around his core belief that everyone in politics should be a lot nicer to each other. This worldview most famously manifested itself in the short-lived March 2015 ""Race Together"" campaign, in which Schultz ― after having mostly eliminated manual espresso machines in Starbucks stores ― tasked baristas with bridging America’s racial divide. If you want a president who believes that all of America’s problems can be solved by constantly throwing corporate culture at them, he’s your guy.', 'Mark Zuckerberg: Hey, let’s see: Do we really want the founder and CEO of Facebook ― a business that depends on learning as much about your private life as possible, more and more every single day, always probing and collecting, never ceasing in its sleepless drive to know everything about you, better than you could possibly know yourself, until the very idea of ""privacy"" becomes an obsolete concept and individual autonomy is subordinated to a set of bloodless algorithms and advertisers are straight-up living inside your dreams ― to be our president? I dunno, man. As Big Brother might say, that sounds doubleplusungood!', 'Chelsea Clinton: Anyone else notice how after the election, Chelsea Clinton has been slowly creeping into our lives? There’s been this gradual ramping up of Total Chelsea Clinton Awareness, and along with it, the gradual ramping up of yet another Clinton’s political career ― even though, up until now, Chelsea Clinton has essentially been nothing more than a lodestar for other people’s money to find their way into Clinton bank accounts. (I read here that she was paid $600,000 to do journalism? Holy cats, how long did it take Jimmy Breslin to make $600,000?) Anyway, she’s been tweeting lately ― tweets that feel a little too clever, but not enough to be thought of as ""edgy"" ― the sort of social media output that makes you want to look for hidden wires. Hillary Clinton got a lot of stick ― unfairly so ― for lacking authenticity, but her daughter’s recent re-emergence feels like a ghost in the shell being willed into existence by a team of P.R. firms. We don’t suspect we have to fear a run in 2020 from Chelsea. But let’s please add every year in the future, ever, to that safe space.', 'Terry McAuliffe: The biggest beneficiary of the Clinton family to not have actual Clinton family DNA (probably, anyway!), McAuliffe revived his political career by winning the 2013 gubernatorial election in Virginia. It was close. Too close, considering he was running against a throwback Christian conservative ideologue in the form of Ken Cuccinelli. During the 2016 campaign, McAuliffe distinguished himself by telling reporters at the Democratic National Convention that Hillary Clinton was definitely going to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal after the election. The TPP, if you recall, was the thing convention-goers booed and jeered more lustily than Donald Trump. McAuliffe and his spin-team later tried to walk this back, saying that it was just McAuliffe who supported the TPP, which ― is still not good? Anyway, he is basically kooky, has a lot of funny-money connections, and suffers from the fact that Virginia has a one-term term limit for governor, leaving him with an itch that has to be scratched, probably with a huge pile of donor money that could be put to any number of more productive purposes.', 'Andrew Cuomo: The Clintons and Cuomos have never been particularly warm to each other, but the two political dynasties, eternally orbiting one another, have managed to seamlessly apply the transactional-slash-triangulating political style they share in common to their interpersonal relationships. Now, as rumors mount that Cuomo is considering a White House bid, he’s welcoming former Clinton campaign staff into his fold, where they’ll likely discover similarities to their natural habitat. Liberals have, in recent months, thrilled to Cuomo’s stance on fracking and his defense of immigrants, but they’re setting themselves up for huge disappointments. Cuomo, who is astonishingly petty and mean-minded, has done more to dampen the fortunes of New York’s Democratic Party than New York Republicans have. And he’s corrupt as all get-out to boot ― his most notable accomplishment as governor was to shut down the Moreland Commission anti-corruption inquiry as soon as the probe starting sniffing around targets with ties to the governor ― and getting away with it.', 'That, right there, is a murderer’s row of the exact wrong candidates for the Democratic Party, who’d be better advised to begin the hard work of rebuilding their party’s foundations and restoring a deep bench of new policymakers with fresh ideas. This is not the moment to try to lock arms with a gaggle of dilettante 1-percenters, promising to do what Trump pulled off. And it’s certainly not the time to try to revive the fortunes of their political cousins ― the broken remnants of the Clinton machine.', 'Drown these candidacies in the bathtub, right now.']",1

""Our baby girl is perfect,"" the proud new father said.', 'The Napolitanos’ love story isn’t isolated. According to Jessica Carbino, Tinder’s on-site sociologist who pores over Tinder’s data, more people than ever are committing to relationships thanks to the app, which will have its fifth anniversary in September.', 'In a report released this week, Tinder conducted two surveys comparing its users with offline daters. (The offline daters fell into three groups: people who have never dated online, people who had dated online in the past but no longer did, and people who had never used online dating but were open to the possibility.)', 'According to Ms. Carbino, the findings indicate that Tinder users are more likely to be looking for a committed relationship than are offline daters.

As a result, she said, the offline daters ""may be a weirdly skewed group, or as sociologists would say negatively select.""', 'Professor Lundquist also questioned the motivations for the survey, pointing to the anecdotal belief among many daters that Tinder’s picture-based feature leads it to be a ""hookup"" app rather than a mechanism for finding long-term partners. ""It seems like Tinder is trying to work on their image with this survey,"" she said.', 'But despite Tinder’s aims, and researchers’ varying methods, the app’s conclusions about the desire of online daters to commit may not be unfounded. In a 2012 report on a study by the sociologists Michael Rosenfeld and Reuben J. Thomas published in the American Sociological Review, the researchers found that couples who meet online are no more likely to break up than couples who meet offline. Mr. Rosenfeld’s continuing research at Stanford University concludes that couples who meet online transition to marriage more quickly than those who meet offline. (The cohort of couples he studied met in 2009, before Tinder was founded; he is currently gathering data that include users of the app.)', 'Still, it is unclear whether Tinder’s surveys, even bolstered by larger trends in online dating, will shift the public’s perception of the app. It does not help that in a recent article in The California Sunday Magazine, Tinder’s founder and chairman, Sean Rad, admitted to sexting with Snapchat users. But perhaps Ms. Carbino, who scours Tinder daily, sees what others can’t: humans trying their best to connect. She is single and said she had found, and lost, love on Tinder.', 'An earlier version of this article misstated Sean Rad’s role at Tinder.

['Why The Apple Watch Will Succeed (Even If It Fails)'],"['Two important, distinct watches bookended my youth. In one corner: the Texas Instruments LED watch, the first digital watch of its kind. In the other: Swatch, the Swiss watch brand that turned the fusty art of time-keeping into a fun, youthful style statement. The TI watch was a feat of technological novelty, but it was neither beautiful nor practical; the LEDs ate up so much battery life that you had to press a button on the side of the band to make time show up. Swatch, on the other hand, worked exquisitely and had a rakish look for everyone under the sun. But the watches were never paragons of technological sophistication.', ""As Apple prepares to debut its long awaited smart watch, it's worth revisiting the tension that has plagued watch innovation for years: The history of watch design is the history of tradeoffs between functional novelty and personal expression. If the Apple Watch succeeds, it will succeed because the company has attended to both ends of the spectrum well enough—and can make up for the rest with its outsize consumer base and loyal development partners."", ""And if it doesn't succeed in those ways? Apple could still win the wearable tech wars."", ""Looking back, the TI watches were scary ugly. But when my older brother got one—I was 10 years old at the time—he and I spent hours pushing the button just to watch those numbers magically appear. It was attractive, not because of its aesthetic, but because it was so new. That's functional novelty. Put a conventional analog watch in the same clothing, and it would have been passed over as cheap and undesirable, even then. It's little surprise that the TI watch, despite all its shortcomings, sold millions."", ""Watch technology has been settled for a long, long time. There have been minor variations in the underlying mechanisms, and TI's LED innovation was an important breakthrough. But for the most part, the technology has been ubiquitous for over a century, and unimpressive for longer."", 'Over the same period, watches have become statements of personal expression, and they have proliferated around this dimension. Swatch took this proliferation to the extreme. (For me, as a teenager, it was the go-to birthday, Christmas and graduation gift.) There are 1.2 billion watches produced around the world today representing perhaps hundreds of thousands of different styles. The only things that distinguish one watch style from the next are fashion features (and price points); you rarely see any kind of functional novelty.', 'Apple is in the rare position to deliver a product that is both functionally novel and chameleon-like in its powers of personal expression.', 'To date, wearable technology has found its center on the ""functional novelty"" end of the spectrum. Call it the left end. It’s Silicon Valley, not New York City. Tech not fashion. Fitbit, Withings, Jawbone—they have all operated from the urge to deliver new use cases to their customers. Just look at their sites; they\'re all about data. Learn more about yourself so that you can be a better human.', 'It\'s not that these companies totally disregard the importance of personal expression. The days are over when you could launch a product without paying heed to its design. But the kind of design you see today does not say, ""I’m wearing this thing because I love how it makes me look."" It’s more about announcing that you belong to a particular club. Take Fitbit. Fitbit devices owe much of their aesthetic to the rubber, yellow Livestrong bands that became popular a decade ago. Users wear them to announce their membership in a league of people who care about pushing themselves physically to be better. The design expresses the personal choices of a very slim (in both meanings of the word) set of the overall population.', ""Apple is in the rare position to deliver a product that is both functionally novel and chameleon-like in its powers of personal expression. For starters, Apple has invested tremendous energy into making the watch customizable. The watch's core is a chicklet able to take on a variety of personalities like no other wearable to date (unless you count Swatch): Two case sizes, four case finishes, and something like a dozen band styles and colors (I lost count while digging through Apple's site) offer more than 100 possible combinations out of the gate. And there is already at least one third-party company building a custom case and band (Epik). Surely others will follow."", ""The Apple Watch isn't a product, it's a platform."", ""On the technological side, Apple may be better poised than any other wearable maker to deliver novel functionality because the company isn't locked into any particular functionality. In contrast to Fitbit, the watch isn’t merely a data collector. It’s a wearable, networked computer that can be programmed for thousands of functions. It’s not a product. It’s a platform that will really come alive when the substantial developer community imagines and builds a dizzying array of apps tailored to the little screen."", ""The perfect analogy here is the iPad. When it launched, many of us knew we wanted one, but we didn’t know exactly what for. Time and endless experimentation has proven that the iPad is a great place to play Angry Birds, among other things. In a similar fashion, the Apple Watch will prove its usefulness once some ingenious app maker reveals to us what we can't live without."", ""It's possible that the developer community never produces the Apple Watch equivalent of Angry Birds. It's also possible that Watch's style options miss the mark and fail to gain critical mass. (Not likely, given Apple's loyal fan base, but possible.) Even then, Apple could still win the wearables war."", ""The big deal in wearable tech is not at all about which particular watch will win the battle for users' wrists. It’s about who will come out on top as the owner of a compelling platform that sits at the center of an entire ecosystem of sensors, software and services just like Apple did for music over a decade ago when they brought the music industry to our fingertips with the iPod and iTunes. In five years, will we talk about how Apple’s Healthkit—the company's software platform that aggregates data from all your health and fitness apps—became the de facto dashboard for our bodies? Or will it be some offering from Google?"", 'Right now, Google is leveraging its acquisition of smart-home products company, Nest, to become that platform leader in the world of home automation. Late last year, Google launched Works with Nest, a partnership program that connects devices together so that, for instance, your Mercedes Benz can tell your Nest thermostat that you’re on your way home. Will they extend this to our bodies, too? I know that I want my home colder right after my workout.', 'For now, Apple may have built the best beta product that will help us figure out what we really want from our wearables.

As of this writing, he's completed almost 20 projects of this ilk, and the work seems to be ramping up. It's not surprising, considering his, let's say, distinctive voice.

['Scientists have found a human protein that blocks Zika virus replication and prevents brain cell death'],"['Summary', 'Zika virus has emerged as a severe health threat with a rapidly expanding range. The IFITM family of restriction factors inhibits the replication of a broad range of viruses, including the closely related flaviruses West Nile virus and dengue virus. Here, we show that IFITM1 and IFITM3 inhibit Zika virus infection early in the viral life cycle. Moreover, IFITM3 can prevent Zika-virus-induced cell death. These results suggest that strategies to boost the actions and/or levels of the IFITMs might be useful for inhibiting a broad range of emerging viruses.', 'Introduction', 'Zika virus has emerged as a severe health threat by virtue of its fast paced global spread and its associated morbidities, including microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Zika virus was initially isolated from an infected macaque in Uganda in 1947, and the first human cases were reported in 1952. Similar to the closely related dengue virus, Zika virus is primarily spread via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. In 2007, Zika virus emerged in Micronesia and expanded its range to Southeast Asia. Zika virus was identified in Brazil in May 2015 and has since led to widespread infection in Central and South America.', 'Zika virus illness has been described as self-limited and moderate in severity with the common findings of malaise, headache, fever, joint aches, a maculopapular rash, and inflammation of the conjunctiva (Haug et al., 2016, Lazear and Diamond, 2016). However, an alarming number of birth defects, including microcephaly, have been attributed to Zika virus infection occurring in the first two trimesters of pregnancy (Driggers et al., 2016, Haug et al., 2016, Rasmussen et al., 2016). In addition, an upsurge in reported cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which manifests as a symmetric ascending flaccid paralysis, have recently been associated with Zika virus infection. Multiple reports have demonstrated that Zika virus can be sexually transmitted via infected seminal fluid, with resultant infection of pregnant mothers', 'the risk of sexual transmission may persist for months after remission of clinical illness (D’Ortenzio et al., 2016). These events have led to Zika virus being declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization.', 'We and others have found that the small membrane-associated interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) can inhibit the replication of a wide range of pathogenic viruses, including all flaviviruses tested to date, including West Nile virus, dengue virus, and reporter viruses carrying the envelope of the Omsk hemmorhagic fever virus (Bailey et al., 2014, Brass et al., 2009, Chesarino et al., 2014a, Chesarino et al., 2014b, Chesarino et al., 2015, Everitt et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2011, Perreira et al., 2013, Tartour et al., 2014). Murine models of Zika virus pathogenesis require an absence of type I interferon (IFN) signaling, suggesting that IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) can prevent heightened levels of infection (Lazear et al., 2016). Further evidence for the protective role of ISGs comes from work showing that placental cells can resist Zika virus infection due to actions of IFN-λ (Bayer et al., 2016). In light of these data, and given that IFITMs are potent inhibitors of flaviviral infection, we wished to determine their effect on Zika virus replication. Using both loss- and gain-of-function examples, we found that both IFITM3 and IFITM1 inhibit the replication of a prototype lab strain of Zika virus first isolated in Africa in 1947 (MR766) (Dick et al., 1952), as well as a more recent strain isolated from a child in Cambodia in 2010 (FSS13025) (Haddow et al., 2012). We found IFITM3 to be more potent than IFITM1 in its inhibition of Zika virus replication. Consistent with this, the loss of a specific endocytosis motif required for the proper localization of IFITM3 is necessary for maximal viral restriction (Jia et al., 2014, John et al., 2013). We also revealed that Zika virus causes a cytopathic effect in HeLa cells and that IFITM3 modulates this phenotype. These data examine the role that specific ISGs might play in the intrinsic immune system’s defenses against Zika virus and further extend the important role played by the IFITMs against viral infection. Our data, and those of others, also suggest that methods of enhancing the actions of IFITMs could serve to ameliorate the global impact on human health created by the expansion of Zika virus, as well as the challenges posed by other emerging viral infections.', 'Results', 'IFITM3 Modulates Zika Virus Replication and Cytopathicity', 'In view of the established role of the IFITMs in the anti-viral response against multiple flaviviruses, we wished to examine the effect of IFITM3 on Zika virus infection (Brass et al., 2009, John et al., 2013). We found that depletion of IFITM3 via a stably transduced short hairpin RNA (shIFITM3) in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells increased Zika virus replication as demonstrated by increased expression of Zika-virus envelope (E) protein staining with a flavivirus cross-reactive antibody that recognizes the E protein, 4G2 (Figure 1A). We obtained similar results by assessing viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a recombinant J2 (rJ2) monoclonal antibody (data not shown). In keeping with these results, IFITM3-overexpressing cells potently blocked viral infection as compared to the shScramble control cells (Figure 1A). We note that the shIFITM3 used in this study spares IFITM1 expression but targets a nearly identical region of both IFITM2 and IFITM3, which differ by only 11 amino acids (Figure S1A) (Feeley et al., 2011, Perreira et al., 2013). Furthermore, we have not found an antibody that can discriminate between endogenous IFITM2 and IFITM3, therefore the increased susceptibility of the shIFITM3 cells to Zika virus infection represents the depletion of both endogenous IFITM2 and IFITM3, with the latter likely playing the predominant role (see Discussion).', 'Zika virus infection has been reported to cause the death of Vero cells but not of human or murine fibroblasts (Way et al., 1976). We therefore wanted to confirm that Zika virus infection caused the death of HeLa cells and whether the loss or gain of IFITM3 impacted this effect. We found that there was a moderate amount of cell death detected after Zika virus infection of the shScramble control cells and that this effect was ameliorated with overexpression of IFITM3 (Figures 1B and 1C). Importantly, the loss of IFITM2 and IFITM3 (shIFITM3 cells) enhanced the susceptibility of the cells to viral cytopathic effect. We saw similar results when using both the MR766 and FSS13025 strains, with the MR766 strain displaying a stronger cytopathic effect. We conclude that IFITM2 and IFITM3 are required for cellular resistance to Zika virus replication and cytopathicity and that the overexpression of IFITM3 can potentiate this protection.', 'IFITM1 Inhibits Zika Virus Replication, and the Proper Localization of IFITM3 Is Needed for Its Full Restriction of Viral Replication', 'We next tested whether overexpression of the IFITM3 paralog, IFITM1, impacted Zika virus replication. IFITM1 and IFITM3 have been shown to have partially overlapping specificities of viral inhibition, with IFITM1 being more potent against viruses that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomal pathway and IFITM3 preferentially acting more strongly against viruses that enter in the late endosomal pathway, such as dengue virus or influenza A virus (Bailey et al., 2014, Chesarino et al., 2014b, Perreira et al., 2013). In keeping with these observations, overexpressed IFITM1 did inhibit Zika virus replication (MR766 and FSS13025 strains), but to a lesser extent than IFITM3, with the caveat that we cannot compare the levels of these two untagged proteins directly (Figures 2A–2C). An IFITM3 mutant, Y20A, which harbors a mutation in a clathrin-mediated endocytosis motif required for proper protein localization in the endosomal pathway, also demonstrated a moderately reduced ability to block viral replication (Jia et al., 2014, John et al., 2013).', 'Deletion of the Murine Ifitm3 Locus Leads to Increased Zika Virus Infection In Vitro', 'Murine Ifitm3 has been shown to prevent viral replication in vitro and also to stop severe influenza in vivo (Brass et al., 2009, Everitt et al., 2012, Feeley et al., 2011). Therefore, we compared Ifitm3+/+, Ifitm3−/−, and Ifitm3−/−Ifitm3 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFS) in the setting of Zika virus infection (MR766 strain), with the latter null cells complemented in trans with a stably transduced murine Ifitm3 cDNA (Lin et al., 2013). These studies revealed an increase in infection in the Ifitm3−/− cells, which was prevented by exogenously expressed Ifitm3 (Figures 3A–3C). We conclude that Ifitm3 protects mouse cells from Zika infection, similar to its role in human cells.', 'IFITM3 Inhibits the Early Stages of Zika Virus Replication', 'The IFITMs have been shown to restrict viral replication by blocking fusion-pore formation and the entry of the viral genome and its associated proteins into the cytosol (Bailey et al., 2014, Brass et al., 2008, Feeley et al., 2011, Li et al., 2013, Lin et al., 2013, Perreira et al., 2013). Therefore, we tested whether altering the levels of IFITM3 could inhibit the early stages of Zika virus infection by using an imaging assay we designed to detect Zika virus RNA. Zika virus (MR766, MOI 50–100) was incubated on ice with HeLa-shScramble, -shIFITM3, and -IFITM3 cells to permit viral binding but prevent endocytosis. Warm media was then added, and at the indicated time points, the cells were washed with cold PBS, incubated with or without trypsin, fixed, immunostained, and confocally imaged with a probe set that recognizes Zika virus RNA. We found that the loss of IFITM3 resulted in increased viral RNA signals (in terms of both intensity and number) as compared to the shScramble control cells (Figures 4A and 4B , Figure S1B). Consistent with this, the overexpression of IFITM3 resulted in little to no detectable viral RNA signals in the cytosol. Given that IFITM3 prevents the fusion of multiple viruses, these results suggest that this assay only recognizes viral RNA once it has exited the viral particle and entered the cytosol subsequent to fusion-pore formation', 'attempts to detect viral RNA fixed to the cell surface in time-zero samples not treated with trypsin showed little to no viral RNA signal, supporting this notion (data not shown). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some viral RNA transcription occurred at these early time points post-infection, and thus it remains possible that the IFITMs act after viral fusion but prior to early viral RNA transcription.', 'Of note, at time zero we saw no differences in viral binding (either in signal intensity or number) to the cell surface across the three cell lines when using samples that were incubated with virus then immediately fixed and immunostained for viral E protein (Figures S1C–S1F). We also estimate that the larger ""spots"" of viral signals (E protein and viral RNA) represent multiple viruses or viral RNAs that are close together and beyond the resolution of this assay, which is 360 nm for the E protein and 400 nm for the viral RNA. Therefore, with individual Zika viruses estimated to be ≈50 nm in size, our imaging assays are not capable of discriminating between individual virions and are thus useful for evaluating the relative level of viral signals rather than their absolute numbers. Taken together, these studies reveal that IFITM3 inhibits the early stages of Zika virus infection that occur after viral-host binding but before either the viral RNA’s cytosolic entry or its early transcription.']",1

['Bill Clinton Never Expected To Get This Disease!'],"['I’ve suffered from seasonal allergies since I was a kid, so I always assumed that life was designed to be a painful, nasally-congested experience for two months out of every year. As I got older, my symptoms got worse. Things eventually got to the point where I would spend almost 24 hours a day in bed during allergy season, trying as hard as I could to breathe through the firmly shut passages in my nostrils. I tried every medication I could get my hands on but they offered minimal improvements at best. I spent my second semester of my junior year at college studying abroad in Italy for six months. I lived in a small town and studied at the local university. A few weeks into the semester I noticed that my allergies had begun to improve. I stopped needing to use my sinus rinses every night before bed and was no longer blowing my nose or hacking up mucous every two minutes. After a few months my allergies had basically disappeared. I couldn’t believe that life could be experienced at this level. I thought such amazing energy was reserved for super heroes, angels and reality TV stars. For the first time since I could remember, I was waking up every morning feeling... energetic. And happy. I started working out in the mornings because I had to find a way to deal with this newfound energy. My friends, teachers and even random people on the street started treating me differently as my social alertness and positive energy came bursting through my pores. My flight back home to Boston at the end of that semester was the culmination of a transformative journey to a higher quality of life. Not just physically, but emotionally as well. It’s hard to realize that you’re depressed if you’ve always been that one way. I didn’t have many friends when I was younger. I had a terrible seIf-image and non-existent self-esteem. Only after coming back from Italy did I realize how much life I had been missing out on. But the joy was short-lived.

But U.S. District Court Judge Bernard Friedman, a conservative, recommended they instead challenge the constitutionality of Michigan's ban on gay marriage."", 'Earlier this month, Attorney General Bill Schuette filed a brief in the case in which he claimed the state\'s definition of marriage was needed to ""regulate sexual relationships"" and their ""unique procreative capacity"":', 'Responsible procreation and childrearing are well-recognized as legitimate State interests served by marriage. One of the paramount purposes of marriage in Michigan -- and at least 37 other states that define marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- is, and has always been, to regulate sexual relationships between men and women so that the unique procreative capacity of such relationships benefits rather than harms society. The understanding of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the rearing of children born of their union, is age-old, universal, and enduring. As illustrated by a plethora of research, social scientists have consistently recognized the essential connection between marriage and responsible procreation and childrearing.', 'In a statement, LGBT advocacy group Equality Michigan Managing Director Emily Dievendorf countered that Schuette\'s stance was ""hypocritical"" and not aligned with the Supreme Court\'s ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act.', '""The U.S. Supreme Court ... found that regulating sex for the purpose of procreation is not a role for our government,"" Dievendorf said in a statement. ""Marriage is about more than just procreation, as the Supreme Court said this June, \'marriage is a way for couples to define themselves by their commitment to each other.\' Suggesting the benefit of marriage is limited to just producing children is more insulting and damaging to the institution of marriage than anything Schuette fears.""', 'This is not Schuette\'s first opposition. When he filed a motion to dismiss the case in July, Friedman denied it, writing that DeBoer and Rowse were ""entitled to their day in court and they shall have it.""', ""After the Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June, Schuette reiterated that the ruling had no effect on Michigan's gay marriage ban."", '""Michigan’s Constitution stands and the will of the people to define marriage as between one man and one woman endures in the Great Lakes State.""', 'But the ""will of the people"" may have changed since 2004, when the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed with 59 percent of the vote. A statewide poll published by the Detroit News earlier this month found that 57 percent of Michiganders support same-sex marriage, a 12.5 percent increase from 2012. However, a poll last month showed that a small majority in Michigan, just over 51 percent, of 600 likely voters would oppose legislation or a ballot measure seeking to allow same-sex marriage.', ""For some Michiganders, Schuette's brief felt deeply personal. Chris Lacefield is trying to adopt a child with his partner. In a blog post Tuesday, he wrote that the state is failing its LGBT community, as well as some of its children:"", '""We want to welcome a child into our home, because we want to start a family,"" he wrote. ""Despite the fact that the state we call home does not recognize our relationship and would not recognize our family, we, like many couples our age, feel the basic human need to provide for the next generation. There are children in Michigan who need loving, stable, two parent homes.

In a response to The Drive’s inquiry and article about this incident, Tesla said the Model S travels at a maximum speed of 1.06 mph while in Summon mode.', 'Overton said he had driven to a business and parked well behind a trailer that was also parked on the same side of the street. Someone from the business came outside to see the car and that after a while — at least 20 seconds — they both went inside. When Overton came back outside he saw the car had driven underneath the back of the trailer, causing what turned out to be $700 in windshield damage.', 'After reporting the incident to Tesla, Overton received a letter from a regional service manager that read in part, ""Tesla has reviewed the vehicle’s logs, which show that the incident occurred as a result of the driver not being properly attentive to the vehicle’s surroundings while using the Summon feature or maintaining responsibility for safely controlling the vehicle at all times.""

The Tesla response said the Summon feature activated three seconds after Overton got out and closed the door.', 'Overton has said he and the employee from the business he visited were outside much longer than three seconds and would have noticed if the vehicle was moving. And even had they not, they would have heard the car hit the trailer in the time it took to walk to and enter the business.', 'After KSL’s initial report on this incident, Tesla got in touch and told them that the Summon feature is in ""beta"" (development) mode but added, ""This feature will park Model S while the driver is outside the vehicle. Please note that the vehicle may not detect certain obstacles, including those that are very narrow (e.g., bikes), lower than the fascia, or hanging from the ceiling. As such, Summon requires that you continually monitor your vehicle’s movement and surroundings while it is in progress and that you remain prepared to stop the vehicle at any time using your key fob or mobile app or by pressing any door handle. You must maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle when using this feature and should only use it on private property.""', 'Tesla is sure that Overton activated the Summon function based on its review of the vehicle’s data (cars have accessible ""black boxes"" just like planes). Overton believes they’re dismissing his version of what happened, even though he and the workman from the other company agree.

['The Galaxy Note 7 gets frozen in a block of ice and dropped from 100 feet – guess what happens!'],"['ALSO READ', ""Equipped with Gorilla Glass 5 and IP68-certified for protection against water and dust, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is a phone to be reckoned with. However, it was yet to prove itself in the ingeniously cruel hands of YouTubers GismoSlip!To really see what the Note 7 is made out of, they encased the phablet in a bowl of ice, then threw the lump of ice with the Note 7 still in it from as many as 100 feet high! We think you will be surprised by the outcome. Not only did the Note 7 withstand over 23 hours of being fully submerged in ice-cold water (that eventually froze), it also managed to get away from the improvised accident without a single scratch. Yes, the smartphone remained fully functional.Well, too bad the software part doesn't stand quite so firm against the strong hardware part. With Note 7's bricking left and right, we can imagine owners of the new handset getting angry enough as to attempt GismoSlip's antics on their own. This is something we strongly advise against, though. You might end up hurting passerby as you drop all that ice from above. And besides, you can always replace your smartphone! We reckon the Note 7 deserves a second chance.Anyway, watch the hilarious video below and let us know what you think!""]",1

I just think you have to find a way to love the person you’re portraying to the degree that that person has regard for himself and that person respects his own opinions and his own rights, and you know, you have to find the center of that person, even if people from the outside see something awful, you have to make it something kind of, for you, doable and real.', 'I worked with Helen Mirren one time and she played this awful person and she said, ""Whenever I have to play someone who’s really detestable, I try and think of what was done to me to make me that way.

Part of that is because Peter and Vince make the show even after we shoot it, which is pretty neat to see how they alter things all the way through the editing process. Yeah, I mean look, this is like, I only have to play my side here so I don’t have to think about the thing in total. I think that Jimmy’s a little — he gets carried away with his enthusiasms, and whatever’s happening in the moment, and that helps me a lot to play those scenes with Chuck and to play a simpler character than Chuck is. Chuck is a more complicated mind.', 'I have a lot of brothers and we don’t have such rivalry, but there’s an intense closeness to your family. Or can be, and [there] certainly is with mine. I think it all rings true.', 'I mean, these are great scenes. They’re wonderful scenes. They ring true all the way through, and I get to play them opposite Michael McKean, which makes me look like a real actor. You know, that was true in Breaking Bad too — working with Cranston and Aaron and Anna Gunn and all. It’s the people around you who raise your game. So I love playing those scenes. I could keep doing them. And they’re extremely rewarding, too.', 'MZS: Can we kind of return to an earlier subject, which is the idea of this as a story of the moral evolution of this guy? It’s not just Jimmy that’s going through it. It’s not just Jimmy. Kim is going through it also, I think. And I would imagine that even Chuck deals with, although he’s very resolute, the question of whether or not to cut his brother a break is something he must surely consider before setting it aside. And then you’ve got all sorts of other characters who are going through that. Is everybody on the show in a way risking the chance of turning into Scarface?', 'PG: I hope they’re not all following in the same path. We try to think a lot about our characters and their choices and who they are and what they want to do. We also try to create contrast between these folks. Everything I say sounds like Writing 101 but there’s no Writing 102. At least that I know of. There’s only the basics and you have to go back to them.', 'One of the basics is contrast. As long as these characters take their own path, they all have their own struggles, then hopefully it creates more depth in Jimmy, and a better understanding of Jimmy.', 'The other possibility is that we just can only see the way we work and the way we think leads to certain results. That’s also possible.', 'MZS: I should clarify. I don’t want you to misunderstand and say that they’re all the same character. I don’t mean it that way, I just mean in the sense of when people ask me who’s the good guy on the show I’m not sure what to tell them.', 'PG: Here’s the thing though. And this is — I struggle with this. Is that people talk about morality as if all — this is going to sound like a Talmudic scholar here. They talk about morality and they’ll make comparisons that to my eyes are ridiculous. They say, well, ""Kim is really just like Jimmy, because Kim participated in this scam or that scam."" Anybody can see there’s a difference between staging a fake billboard thing and possibly getting somebody to pay for an expensive bottle of booze. It’s that, there are different qualities.', 'We had this on Breaking Bad , where people would say, ""Well, Marie shoplifts, so it’s really just the same as cooking meth."" What?', 'And the truth is that we all have — and we try to use our own lives in [writing] this — our own struggles about self-interest, and also following the rules, and also what you owe other people with your life. And Chuck has this way of thinking that’s wonderful because he has this wonderful ability to apply a very strict morality. And it’s not just morality, it’s about rules, it’s about following the rules. I actually have a lot of respect for Chuck.', 'We’re very lucky, because these actors are so much fun to work for. The characters are so much fun to write for. And to make it sound like we’ve got it all planned out is maybe doing the show a disservice. Because a lot of it is about process, a process of playing the game that we’ve established and trying to be true to where these folks are.', 'I don’t really think, Is this about a moral descent? And that’s a very good question. I think that we’ll find that out as the seasons go on, because Kim and Chuck are both going to be faced with a lot of tough choices, and it’s possible, I personally think it’s possible, that any of these characters could maybe not have a moral descent. Maybe there could be redemption. People get better as well as get worse. It doesn’t all move in one direction. I think a lot of it is to be continued.', 'MZS: [ To Seehorn ] Can you talk a little bit about Kim in relation to these questions?', 'RS: No!', 'MM: She’s always like this. Slip her a 20.', 'RS: Talk about Kim and the issues of morality?', 'MZS: And also just the way that she’s trying to make her own way in the world. And it’s very, very difficult for her because, on the one hand, she’s a woman in this all-male firm and also she doesn’t really seem to fit in there. Jimmy at least realizes he doesn’t fit in.', 'What are some of the characteristics of Kim, and what are some of the issues that you are dealing with when thinking about how to play these scenes?', 'RS: I think you’re right, too, and by right I mean because it aligns with what I thought, the presumption that she seems like a little bit of an outsider where she is, too. And I think that that’s one of the similarities that she shares with Jimmy.', 'When people would ask me at first, ""How are those two people together? They seem so different,"" I always saw more about them that was alike. I think that they’re both loners in a way. They’re both kind of outsiders trying to fit in, and they both, in some cases literally, know the right suit to wear and the right mask to wear for the environment they’re in. And she is trying to fit in.', 'I tell people sometimes the specific artistry that goes into the whole show is deeper than even the viewers see. Jennifer Bryan, our brilliant costume designer — we talk about that. When I went in for my first fitting, instead of it being about anything that you might get at some other fittings I’ve had in my career, that’s about low-cut shirts or what kind of hot pants would this person wear, she said, ""I think Kim’s trying to fit in but she can’t afford the suits they’re wearing yet. So even though you’ll be wearing navy blue and black, the audience won’t be able to see it, but I want you to know that I think they should be mismatched, because she still buys separates at Marshalls and Nordstrom Rack, trying to look like she has the full suit. And I literally started crying. I was having conversations about character at your costume fitting! To know that that’s how much everybody is rowing this ship is a beautiful experience for an actor.', 'I’m aware of Vince and Peter being two of the best people that can helm a ship, ever, I’m aware of that. But I’m also aware that they think that this is a collaborative art form. And you feel that when you’re on set and you feel that when you’re with the crew and when you’re prepping.', 'That being said, I do think she’s trying to fit in. And I like what Peter’s saying. I think the danger to any of these characters, I think, is when they think things are black-and-white. And I understand the comfort it gives all of us, and I think the audience feels this when you think about things in black-and-white terms. Like, If I just keep my head down and work hard enough things will be okay . And that’s not true, and it’s unsettling when that’s not true. And it’s not true for Kim and Jimmy, she needs Jimmy as much as Jimmy needs her, I think.', 'I do not think it’s a one-sided street at all, and when he tells her people do have personal agendas, people do have ulterior motives, you can’t just say like, Nope, I’ll pick myself up and I’ll fix this and I’ll do it myself. He warns her of those things and he is right in many respects — that there are things at play going on in her world that she can’t fix on her own, just by working hard enough and trying to do the right thing. She’s wrestling with that gray area and I think that that makes her more accessible to the audience — that it’s not just about being flawed, it’s about the struggle to decide.', 'Your moral compass, unfortunately, won’t stay on north when you move. You know what I mean? It just depends on who’s standing in front of you. It depends on what the situation is. And that’s the possible danger or the possible redemption for all of us, when you go: All right, it’s gray, everything is gray. Now what do you want to do?', 'MZS: It’s interesting that the two most important people in Jimmy’s life are both people who are constitutionally almost incapable of asking for help: Chuck and Kim.', 'RS: Yeah, she’s definitely a little anti asking for help. Yeah, and so is Chuck. And both of them get forced into positions where they have to ask for help.', 'MM: Chuck feels he’s entitled to it.', 'RS: True. You’re so terrible to Ernie.', 'PG: Chuck got his brother out of jail.', 'RS: Right.', 'PG: I feel like Chuck has been there for Jimmy all through Jimmy’s life when he really needed him. It does roll the other way.', 'MM: But it was easy when Jimmy was a soft target. When Jimmy was not an active participant in my life it was very easy because then he was an infant, he was a blob. But the most spine —', 'PG: Bob can hear you.', 'MM: He’s back in the bathroom. No, what I’m saying, when Jimmy was just a problem that I was, that I had to take care of, that was easy. When Jimmy became a lawyer, he became a very strange nightmare. It’s different. Time changes things.', 'MZS: Can we talk a little bit more about the intricacies of the wardrobe?', 'MM: No white buttons. You will never see men’s shirts with white buttons on our show.', 'RS: I didn’t know that. Why is that?', 'MM: [Jennifer Bryan] hates them.', 'RS: No character narrative.', 'MM: Especially a black shirt with white buttons. Anything other than a white shirt that has white buttons on it sends her right up the wall. It’s amazing.', 'RS: And as far as the fitting, another costume thing, and you see it, I think, only in one scene and it’s when he finally busts the Kettlemans and is sitting on their fireplace area in season one. You finally see his shoes, which are one of my favorite things, and they’re either Ferragamo or Gucci. The horse-bit logo, you know, that has the two metal rings and then the bar? And one of his is being held together by a paper clip. And they’re really old and worn out.', 'We had a couple of really early calls [while shooting that scene], and maybe [during] the first run of the scene you’re like, you know, trying to make sure you’re very present in the scene. And I would just look at his loafers and know instantly why Kim loves Jimmy. He’s fucking holding it together with a paperclip.', 'MM: Jonathan Banks, now, he is America’s badass. When he and Lee Marvin meet in heaven, hopefully a long, long way in the future, Lee’s going to go [ shudders ]. That’s how badass Jonathan Banks is. And he’s an amazing actor, he’s one of those.', 'I mean, you see!', 'RS: And a teddy bear in real life. He doesn’t want to tell anyone.', 'MZS: He’s also very, very, very, very drily funny. Like parched humor. I actually met Jonathan Banks after Lincoln Center played all of Breaking Bad , in a marathon [that ran] for a month before the finale of the show. And I went to a reception and Jonathan Banks was there with his daughter, who I think runs the social-media accounts for Jonathan Banks.', 'RS: Oh, Rebecca.', 'MZS: Yeah — and I went up to him and I just introduced myself . I said I’m a TV critic for New York Magazine and he said, ""Oh, have you ever written about the show?"" ""Yeah, like 650 times."" And I said, ""As a matter of fact, I tweeted about you just this morning."" And he said, ""You ‘tweeted’ about me.""', 'And I said, ""Yeah.""', 'And he said, ""I’m not ‘online.\'""', 'RS: No way.', 'MZS: I believed him.', 'RS: He’s a great guy, and it’s so funny because people tend to — I’ve found — approach actors if they want to come up, a fan wants to come up and talk to you, they tend to approach you in the vein of the character that you most recently played. So if you’re playing a very open, accessible person people will walk up to you. Like I played a [terrorist] once and people were like, ""Aahhhh, I loved you."" So with Jonathan and Bob, Bob is — can you hear me?', 'BO: I can hear you.', 'RS: Don’t you find that when we would go out to the diner or something — Bob plays this very gregarious talkative person and Bob’s very generous and sweet and I would say this even if he couldn’t hear me. He’s very kind and generous with fans but can be a little more shy than they would expect as a person in real life. Less gregarious and jolly. But they’ll walk right up to him because they’re just like, ""Hey, it’s Saul, ahhblahblah !"" Jonathan, they expect like he might shoot them. So I’ll be in the diner and people are talking to Bob, and they walk by Jonathan.', 'There was a Marine, a big guy, that came by and just gave his business card and he’s like, [ very quickly ] ""I don’t want to bother you, I just want to tell you ..."" Left his card and ran away! And then the deal is, though, in real life they’re the opposite. While Bob can be pleasantly surprised by the fans, and shy at times to accept the attention, Jonathan is like, ""Get back over here and talk to me! What are you doing?""', 'He wants to talk to everybody. He’s like your favorite weird uncle at every barbecue.', 'MM: There’s one quick note to that, though. Have you ever been with Jonathan at a restaurant and he doesn’t like his food? The look that he gives the waiters ... [ withering glance ] and once they’re all the way at the table [ another scary look ]. He’s hardly said anything and the guy has shit himself and is on his way back to the kitchen.', 'It’s wonderful, and it’s like he’s using a kind of currency. It’s just genuinely off-putting and charming as hell.', 'RS: Yes. And he uses them both to his advantage at all times.', 'He also doesn’t like being looked at by fans, like stared at without them saying something. So you’ll often be eating with him and people will be at the outside table thinking they’re being covert, and he will get up and be like, ""If you’re going to stare at me, talk to me!""', 'But he’s so great and he’s so loving and generous and he loves his job. Like after, what is it, like 50 years or something? He still loves it. He loves to prep for it, he loves to work on it he likes to work with other actors. He’s great.', 'MZS: Bob, are you still there?', 'BO: Yeah.', 'MZS: Can you jump in on this? You’ve logged more screen time with Jonathan Banks than I think anybody on the show.', 'BO: Not enough! Let’s go, get those two in the parking booth.', 'MZS: I mean with Breaking Bad included.', 'BO: Yeah! He’s, what can I say? He’s the best. He’s hilarious and he brings all that energy and very naturally falls into the role, although he is a super-sweet guy in real life. He’s a softy, I think, you have to say.', 'But honestly, when people ask me what do I hope happens next in the show, I hope that there’s more scenes with me and, you know, with Jimmy and Mike. Because together it does really feel like a comic duo. I just can’t help but giggle whenever my character is standing face-to-face with that guy. Because they just hate each other and need each other and it’s just the best.', 'MZS: Yeah, sometimes the two of you remind me of that Warner Bros. cartoon with the bulldog and the little dog he hauls around. What do you want to do today, Spike? I do hope you get more scenes with him.', 'RS: We all do.', 'MM: I’m still waiting. I can’t even think of a way they’d be in the same room. [ To Gould ] Work on it.', 'MZS: Seriously, you’ve got your notes for today.', 'RS: Kim is so reserved. Would they just have a staring contest?', 'PG: You have the big wheel of characters. Okay, here you go!', 'MZS: Let’s talk about Chuck and Kim versus Jimmy and Mike in one respect, which is: We know eventually where two of these characters are going to end up, and we also know that they can’t die, I don’t think.', 'And so in a sense for me at least much of the suspense of the show is concentrated on your two characters. We don’t know what’s going to happen, but also, they could kill you.', 'MM: People also leave Albuquerque rather than dying. That could happen too.', 'PG: This is something that puzzled me for quite a while because people would ask and they’d always say, ""Well, Kim dies right? Or Chuck dies."" And at first I thought, Well, hold on ... imagination. As Michael says, there’s a lot of things that could happen other than people being alive or dead. But then I think I’ve come to another conclusion — and you tell me if you guys agree — I think it’s like, they care, and they feel that these characters are in danger, because there’s that question mark.', 'And that’s also because these are Jimmy’s two compass points. These are the two characters who he has the most invested in — and deeply. There’s deep connections between Jimmy and both these guys.', 'I take that as a compliment or an admonishment not to take this too lightly, because the idea, there’s a lot that can happen, other than people ...', 'MZS: Well, there is — and I don’t want to seem argumentative; but then, I am a critic: You say there are other alternatives, that they could just leave it open or do something like that. But the audience loves these two characters so much that if you were to say you know Kim has moved to Saskatchewan, she’s not on the show anymore, people will be mad at you.', 'PG: Well, if we did it off-screen they would be. But I’m just going to argue back. Anything you do has to be played out dramatically. We’re all familiar with TV shows where a character just disappears season to season, and the other characters go, ""Oh yeah, they moved."" Because we couldn’t negotiate a contract with that person! And that’s what we want to avoid. Personally, I feel like there’s a lot more to say about both of these folks.', 'RS: Well, that’s good! Invite me to this panel to be fired!', '[ Audience laughter ]', 'RS: I was surprised by the number of people that thought there was only one conclusion. I was like, have you seen the writing that Vince does here? You [Peter] and Vince and Bob all addressed on one panel that we did that idea that you only saw Saul in such specific circumstances during Breaking Bad that there’s no reason why the two of us could exist or not exist in that world in some capacity. People are like: He never talks about his brother or Kim. I was like, Would you talk to Tuco? I have a girlfriend, she lives here! There’s so many possibilities to, with the Saul character, because it’s so contained. He’s always in life-or-death circumstances, in little tiny places.', 'MZS: That’s an interesting way to think about it, though — this idea that on a television show, when there are story lines and characters that we love, we want them to be present all the time.', 'And I myself as a viewer experience this a lot. If one of my favorite characters is not on a show for a week or two weeks or three weeks I start to get a little antsy, kind of resenting the show, like: What’s next ? But on some of the larger-cast shows, it’s almost inevitable that you’re going to go a week or two without seeing a [particular] person.', 'I interviewed the showrunners of The Americans , and within the course of the season there’ll be working different contacts, I guess, trying to turn somebody, blackmail somebody, and there’s different character arcs [for those characters]. I said, ""Well, after the first story line is done,"" and one of the executive producers said, ""Well, you don’t know that she’s done, we’re just not showing you what’s going on. She could be back six months from now or a year from now, whatever.""', 'How do you handle that as a storyteller? Because sometimes shows run into trouble with that, where shows feel that they have to service every character?', 'PG: That is a problem. I mean, it’s certainly something we think about. We spend a lot of time talking about what’s going on with each of these characters.', 'But ultimately we have to go where the story takes us, if that makes any sense. We’re in the writers room, we’re always pitching. [ To Seehorn and McKean ] You guys are talking about having scenes with Chuck and Mike or whatever. We talk about those all the time. We come up with crazy scenarios. If it defies logic, if human behavior doesn’t follow the same lines, then we have to discard those.', 'But having said that, you know, [in] the first episode last season, season two, there’s no Chuck. No Chuck.', 'MZS: Right.', 'PG: No Chuck in the episode. And sometimes, you know, in the beginning of season one there’s very little Kim.', 'And the wonderful thing we have is that these actors have given us so much freedom and trust. We don’t suddenly get calls from agents: [ whispers ] ""Why isn’t Mike in this?"" We don’t. They’ve given us the creative freedom. We have mutual trust that somehow we’re going to try and get it right.', 'And I think the audience also understands that each episode is a unit, and we try and make each episode entertaining and complete in its own way. But we’re telling a story that goes on. And sometimes the story takes you down little eddies, or you end up going, as we did at the end of season one, to Cicero for most of an episode, and so we had very little. And that killed me, because I directed that one and I had very little of these two guys in that episode [indicating McKean and Seehorn] and I didn’t like that.', 'But it was where the story took us. And so that’s not a great explanation but I think as long as we try to have — try to keep in mind who these characters are and why they’re doing what they’re doing, I don’t think we’ll go too far wrong. I hope not. It’s served us so far.', 'MZS: I’d like to zero in on the storytelling just a little bit more. Which is — and talk about the look of the show, the feel of the show, the rhythm of the show, which is different from a lot of what you see on television drama in at least two respects. One of them is visually. There’s a lot of thought put into every shot, every camera move, every cut. That’s true for Breaking Bad as well. And also the length of scenes. It’s a one-hour show, which is what, 42, 43 minutes?', 'PG: I think we’re more like 47.', 'MZS: 47.', 'MM: Thank you, AMC!', 'MZS: But within that, there are many dramas, which for the moment will be unnamed, where scenes will be 30 seconds, 45 seconds.', 'This show doesn’t usually do that. You’ll stay in a scene, it feels like they’re more shaped.', 'And within that there’s a sense of architecture in how a scene is built. What I’m wondering is, how do you integrate that with the performances? Because I’ve heard from a number of actors who’ve worked with highly controlled filmmakers, people like Tim Burton or Steven Spielberg, or someone like that, [that] they enjoyed the experience, they’re proud of their work on it, but there’s also something that can be frustrating about it, because you’re acting in pieces: this shot or that shot. It’s like, Now we’ve got that five-second piece that we need; now we’re going to completely relight the set and we’re going to come in from this angle and do this other thing.', 'How do you reconcile that? I mean, you can’t just stick the camera on a tripod and say, Now I have the scene, guys . A lot of shows can.', 'PG: This is a big question. We are very fortunate in that we have an incredible group of filmmakers working on the show. We have wonderful directors, you saw two clips there; so far you’ve shown one from Michelle MacLaren, who is just an astounding director.', 'MZS: One of the best action filmmakers in the world.', 'PG: Absolutely. And then you have Thomas Schnauz, who wrote and directed the last clip that you showed. These are people who really care deeply about how the story’s told visually. And so that’s very important. And we also have Arthur Albert and his team. And Arthur Albert’s —', 'RS: Our [director of photography].', 'PG: He’s incredible. He’s an incredible DP and a wonderful human being. Everybody really cares about the way the show looks. It’s interesting because the way you say it, it sounds almost in opposition. That here we have the way the show’s presented visually and here we have performance. I don’t really feel that those two things are in opposition, myself. I think that, and especially when you have actors up here who are both incredible stage actors. These are incredible performers in live situations as well as in film. They can do anything that we ask them. They have such ability and facility in what they do that it’s not like we’re asking people to — hopefully we’re not asking them to restrain themselves because of the way the show is shot.', 'And also I think to a great extent that’s the job of the director, to be able to capture the performance and also capture the visual context. So I don’t really think those two things are in opposition to me.', 'But in the end, when we’re sitting in the editing room — by the way, we have to also mention our editors. Led by Kelley Dixon and Skip MacDonald. They have a wonderful sensitivity to the characters and the performances. And if we get into the editing room and we have some clever visual idea but it undermines the moment, or if it’s not the best moment for me personally, we’ll go for the performance, we’ll go for the character.', 'But having said that, these [actors] give us something wonderful from every angle. And I’m not blowing smoke. Oftentimes, and I was lucky enough to get to direct both of them in a scene together late in the last season. And the hardest thing about editing that scene was that there was something wonderful and something different —', 'RS: The three-way confrontation. [Episode] nine.', 'PG: — where Kim finally tells Chuck off. I shot the hell out of it, these guys acted the hell out of it, and then we had to just decide where we wanted to be. Because everywhere we could be, there was something interesting. And so much of that is just attributable to the fact that they do such detailed work. And they also come in prepared, and on a television schedule it’s, and Bob — Bob?', 'He went somewhere.', 'MM: [ Addressing the ceiling with a prayerful expression ] Dear Bob.', 'PG: Bob works every weekend; usually each episode each week there’s a couple big scenes and the cast will get together.', 'RS: We rehearse off campus.', 'PG: They rehearse off campus. And that, boy, I’ll tell you, that makes a huge difference because when you come in and you say, Well, I know you guys worked on this, can you show me what you did ? I go, Oh this is going to be great . All I have to do is shoot it.', 'RS: Well, there’s also two things. I feel like none of us wants the words to get hidden away. You’re right, these are eight- and ten-page dialogue scenes, which is unusual. And you want to get that, you want to be able to play with everything except trying to remember your lines. Because it just hinders you. You don’t get as much time to play and make up different ways to do it. And I don’t know about you, but I feel like some of what you’re talking about — visually when there’s extreme angles we’re using cinematic wides, which is also unusual on television. Certainly before Breaking Bad and now both of our shows use them.', 'Maybe it is they’re [skilled] stage performers, so there’s a comfort level with playing a whole scene as though it’s a play. And being able to play it with your whole body, knowing that your dramatic or sometimes dark comedic moment isn’t going to be here [ gestures to face ], if the best way to play it is the slope of the shoulders instead of squeezing out a tear that’s going to be allowed, too, and that’s going to be on film and might be the cut that’s used. I find freedom in that.', 'I also find freedom in the fact that AMC and Sony do not note them to death, so we don’t get rewrites, which is unheard of. You get a script and you get to go rehearse it and that’s it. There will be no rewrites.', 'Often [in television] you’ll get a scene, and you can start to work on it, but most likely it will be slightly altered to very altered the next day. And every day a network is watching it be rehearsed, or watching a daily and then giving notes and changing it, and the actor is trying to keep up. And so you can’t marry yourself to beats of a scene.', 'We’re getting eight- to ten-page dialogue, beautiful plays, beautiful little short films in and of themselves and then there’s freedom when we get there because now we’re going to just spend our time doing it 50 different ways and finding the right — like you said — the architecture of what the story line is.', 'MM: And it’s much more fun doing those scenes that last 30 seconds, because then you feel like an accomplice in a cheat. If you see a scene and you say, Oh, I get this , this is a page and a half and it ends with someone looking at the other person and going, ""Do I, Steve? Do I?"" That’s all we need folks, because nobody gives a shit.', 'The other point is, there are people — and thank God that we don’t have this — but there are people who are very, very good writers who are not getting notes from the studio or from the network but are rewriting constantly anyway. You know there are people who autonomously say, You know what, that big speech that you’ve got on page six here, I’ve totally changed it and we shoot in 30 seconds .', 'MZS: You’re working with David Milch now?', 'MM: I wasn’t going to mention that! My one experience with Milch was exactly the opposite. But I had heard that he would do that on Deadwood . Jim Beaver was talking about that, that he would suddenly say, ""Yeah, I wrote this this morning around four and I’d like to do this instead of this other one."" And then it’s like, ""Well okay, thank God that I’m a robot.""', 'Whatever the case, Milch’s stuff hits the air looking pretty damn good so it’s like: There are all different kinds of processes.', 'But like I say, it’s so much more fun to work on an eight-page scene that is about the way human beings really do interact with one another rather than something that looks like a clip reel. It’s just a different deal.', 'RS: And then our directors and our editors allow us to breathe in the scenes, which is also unusual. You can hold and it’s not going to be cut. You can know that.', '[In] my scenes with Bob, there’s so much more that’s between the lines than on the lines, which I think portrays the history of a relationship. It’s what doesn’t have to be said. And we’re able to do that and know in our hearts it’s not going to get cut. They’re not going to try and make it snippy. They’re going to try to let it breathe.', 'MZS: Yes, you know, you and Peter both mentioned theater, and something kind of clicked for me when you said that, because that is an area where you can have an extremely controlled visual [that’s] very, very exact from moment to moment, and also have long scenes where things can breathe.', 'Something about the lighting on the show often looks theatrical. Where you’ll see a wide shot where three-quarters of the frame will be black. And it almost looks like there’s a spotlight on Kim or on Chuck. Something like that. Or old movies.', 'RS: Yeah, that film-noir stuff.', 'MZS: You talk about old movies? Do you think about old movies when you’re working on the show?', ""PG: Yeah, we talk probably more about old movies than anything else. We quote dialogue to each other. This is special for me to be right here where we are at Milk Studios because I grew up about three blocks from here, going to what’s now the Joyce, but I think at the time was called the Elgin. It was a revival house and getting to see — this was of course a period before home video. New York was filled with old movies. There was the Elgin, the 8th Street Playhouse, there was the Thalia, which I think still exists. Those for me were the formative experiences, watching movies that were made mostly before I was born. A lot of them silent movies from the '30s, '40s, and '50s."", ""And those are things that we talk about in the writers room. There are certain movies from the '70s, too. Certainly on Breaking Bad , The Godfather was something that we [talked about], that’s sort of the Ur-text for people of my generation, filmmakers of my generation. And certainly one of our touchstones on that show."", ""But this show, for me a lot of this show has influences, things like Billy Wilder movies. There are a few moments that really feel like that. Or movies from the '40s, the Preston Sturges films."", 'One of the things I love about Kim is that she seems to me in some ways to be in that tradition of female characters who could really hold the tiller of their own ship, who are self-contained, who are with the people they’re with because they want to be, not because they have to be.', 'There’s something about Rhea right now, in fact, with your hair, all feels like an echo of that.', 'RS: Not the first time I’ve been told I’m from the wrong era.', 'PG: So many of us!', 'So old movies, those are very important to all of us as a writer. A lot of film buffs in the writers room. Film buffs from different eras, though. That’s one of the things that’s terrific about it. I tend to skew, I’ll be the one who talk about [older films] and then we have also some folks who are more contemporary in their taste, which is good.', 'MZS: I think we have time for some questions. Can we do that?', 'MM: Can we make the lighting more oppressive? There was a moment there I wasn’t squinting at all.', 'There are people out there! You will get quieter as you speak into the microphone.', 'Audience member 1 : Okay, I’ll try to speak extra loud then. Well first of all, I want to say thank you from all the fans for creating such an awesome show. It really makes it easy for us to be fans and we all, I think I can collectively say that we all love the show. So thank you all. Thank you, Bob in the sky. So my question I guess is actually for Peter. At the beginning of this conversation you said there’s no happy endings in showbiz. But I wanted to ask you whether there was the potential for happy endings in the Breaking Bad / Better Call Saul universe for anybody at all.', 'PG: I think so. I don’t think anything’s predetermined. We try not to; I don’t think so. Even with Breaking Bad we had a story that was set up from Vince from the beginning, which was Mr. Chips turns into Scarface. This show we have Jimmy McGill becomes Saul Goodman. Which in some ways seems is not quite as extreme a journey. It’s a different kind of journey. But then we also have the fact that this character, we also see as Gene in Omaha, Nebraska, working at a Cinnabon. So that, to me that hints that maybe there’s more to the story after Breaking Bad . So we’ll see.', 'MZS: I’ve actually wondered about that in the context of old movies. This, we could be in for a Third Man ending. Harry Lime comes back. Sorry, I spoiled it for you. 1948 so deal. Anybody else?', 'Audience member 2 : As an attorney I’m very intrigued by how much practicing law is part of the show. Do you get counsel from lawyers on ""okay, Kim should be doing doc review?"" Where do you get the nitty-gritty details from?', 'PG: Absolutely. One of the things I’m so proud about is the fact that we have a law show that the legal cases are old folks getting overcharged for toilet paper, drunk and disorderly, then there’s interstate banking regulations.', 'RS: Solicitation.', 'PG: I think one of our great concerns going into this was that it would be a law show. Because neither Vince nor I have that bend. We don’t have that procedural bend and we sure as hell don’t know anything about law. Luckily we’ve had a lot of help and fortunately we have some folks in the writers room who are from families of lawyers. Especially Gordon Smith. Both his mother and his sister are attorneys and we’ve had a lot of attorneys come and help us out. Season one there was more about small-scale criminal law. Moving into larger cases. And then season two we had to learn about things like doc review. We just tried to find out, what’s the bad job that Kim would get if she was out of favor.', 'RS: But then I spent all morning, like they brought in someone that literally showed you how you catalogue those things and stamp them all and code them and what you would highlight and how you would put it back in the box with a marker. Because it needs to look like something somebody had done a million times. That they could do without thinking.', 'PG: And all those documents, they actually had text that was relevant. It was written by our folks back in Burbank, led by Ariel Levine, who was at the time, I don’t know what she was but now she’s our writers’ assistant. But she and some of the other folks in the office wrote hundreds of pages of legal documents for you to overline.', 'RS: Yup.', 'PG: And for you to read when you were doing the big banking meeting.', 'MM: Well, here’s a little secret: I can’t read a thing without my glasses so I’m just faking. I wasn’t really taking anything in. Everything else I do is real but the reading is — You could say Mike McKean’s an asshole on every page and I would not know it. I mean, I’d know it but I wouldn’t know it from reading.', 'MZS: My friend Alan Sepinwall likes to imagine an alternate universe where you and Vince Gilligan do this meeting first and he wants to see a pitch meeting where you propose Jimmy McGill, elder-care lawyer.', 'Audience 3: I’m also a lawyer, not from this country, and I find it very interesting how you got a very, what I would consider a very ... in the Chuck character a very rule-oriented and very sort of procedural and knowledgeable person. And then this very extreme other character and I wondered did you actually model these two characters on actual lawyers or are you just thinking that they’re ordinary people that just happen to be lawyers?', 'MM: I take everything off the pages that we get for these guys. I had no model in my head about what this lawyer was. And I count on them. Everything I saw before me felt genuine and again they didn’t pitch me the entire season before. I didn’t know where it was going.', 'PG: Neither did we.', 'MM: Right, exactly. Which is why. I remember we were doing the fifth or sixth show and you called, you and Vince called and told me about the show where it was, it was the ninth episode of the first season where it was kind of revealed that Chuck’s been working behind the scenes to dynamite Jimmy’s progress. Which is a polite way of putting it. But it all made sense and it was almost like, Well, we’re giving you a heads-up here. It’s going to take a turn . I didn’t see the turn. I didn’t see it coming necessarily but it all made sense so like I said, I repeat myself, but it really is on the page. They tell me when I’m on the right track by putting it in the show.', 'PG: That’s exactly right. One of the glories of this particular kind of writing in filmmaking is that we get to watch the performances and learn about the characters from the way the actors interpret the characters. Kim was shaped a lot by Rhea’s interpretation of Kim. And likewise Michael, when we started the season, season one, Vince and I had written the scene between Chuck and Jimmy and there was a dimension to what you did in the scene and in the subsequent scenes that I hadn’t anticipated, I don’t think we anticipated. Which was, and I think it was maybe you could argue it was there in the writing but we didn’t see it until you did it. It was Chuck’s kind of gravitas and his pride. What a person he is to be reckoned with. Then we asked ourselves, Well, how does this guy feel about having Jimmy McGill for a brother ? And in a lot of ways, that insight has led to almost everything we’ve done since. But if we had to write the whole season as I know some people do, and then shoot it we would have never come to that. We would have never been able to watch what we were seeing coming in from the set or watch the rehearsals and go, Wait a minute, I see something else in this person. Something that I wasn’t expecting . And then write to that.', 'MZS: Can I follow up on that and ask: Have you or any of the other writers on the show taken a character in a different direction or given a character some different type of business or some new ability based on the actors? Or had a conversation with the actors, can you give me an example?', 'PG: Absolutely. Bob, I don’t know if you’re there, but Bob is — you’re well known for your British accents, aren’t you? You’re incredible at good British accents, isn’t that right?', 'BO: I’m renowned for being able to cram all the various accents of Britain into one sound.', 'PG: And I believe you’re also known for your singing abilities.', 'BO: I am. Equally. I am used as a reference point. I don’t know for what. What not to do.', 'PG: Since we know this about Bob, any time that we can have him sing or do a British accent, those are things we certainly — Michael is so musical that having him play the piano was a natural —', 'MM: Fake!', 'RS: He can play, really well.', 'PG: You are musical though.', 'MM: I play the guitar.', 'PG: You play the guitar. If we had had a guitar.', 'RS: Bob is a renowned bagpipe player, though.', 'RG: I want to get you out of your comfort zone.', 'Audience member 4: This is a question for Peter. How is the writing process for Better Call Saul different from Breaking Bad , by virtue of it being a prequel? And what I mean by that is are there certain threads, plot threads, that you in the writers room want to go down but then you realize we can’t contradict this background detail that we introduced in Breaking Bad ? Does that force you to be a bit more creative with how you develop different ideas and story lines but still be within the lines at least. We want Mike to shoot Hector Salamanca but we know that he can’t by virtue of Hector still being alive. We know that Jimmy never meets Gus. So, how does that force you to develop, or maybe work a little bit backwards?', ""PG: You picked two great examples. We have 62 episodes of Breaking Bad that we decided we want to abide by. I’ve had people pitch to me that actually maybe Jimmy never becomes Saul Goodman and that just turns out to be an alternate take. But we’re squares so we won’t do that. It makes our lives incredibly difficult that we know some of these characters never met each other. There are characters we’d love to have on from Breaking Bad who we just know met Jimmy/Saul for the first time on Breaking Bad . We'll come up with pitches and then someone will have to say, Well, it always seemed like Jimmy didn’t know this character or that character or Saul didn’t know this character or that character and so those wonderful pitches will have to go in the trash for the moment. So as you said, certain limitations actually force you to be a little more creative."", 'We experience this, we do this all the time to ourselves. The example I remember on Breaking Bad was that in the fifth season we had this machine gun, we flashed forward and we saw Walt with a beard, the house was all destroyed and in his trunk he had this machine gun. That’s more or less how it went. We had no idea how he was going to use the machine gun or who he was going to use it on and I can’t tell you how many times in the writers room Vince would say, ""Oh we could do anything if we just didn’t have that that fucking machine gun in the trunk."" And we keep doing this to ourselves because now we have Omaha and we know certain things about Omaha that we’ve learned and then the disappear-er and there’s all kind of things that we know that we want to abide by. We know a little bit about Chuck’s wife Rebecca. These are all things that are limitations but they often turn out to be the seeds of ideas and one of the tricks I think we learned on Breaking Bad was that a lot of time when people talk about writing they talk about going in the future and figuring out where you’re going and: Okay, we’re going to put these landmarks up in the future and this is where we’re going to go and the characters are going to do this and that and the other thing .', 'That’s valuable in itself but the thing I don’t hear people talking about that I think is just as valuable is going backward in your story. And saying, Is there, what was it they said about this, what was that look that Kim gave Jimmy in that particular scene? What did that mean? Or, I always thought this about the way these two characters were but maybe there’s another way to look at it . So we spent a lot of time actually going over territory that we’ve already been in and trying to figure out if there’s more use to be made of the material that’s already been on the show. And I think that’s one of the things that hopefully makes it feel, as much as we can, makes it feel like an integrated whole.', 'MZS: Somebody once built a very convincing case to me that this entire show was just Saul’s expanded fantasy while he was working at Cinnabon. That was the saddest thing I’d ever heard in my life.', 'PG: Would you guys find that satisfying? Show of hands?', 'Audience member 5: Hi, thank you for doing this. One of my favorite parts of this season was the montages that we see. I’m thinking of Kim and the rainbow Post-it notes or Jimmy trying to get fired with the wacky inflatable-arm man. Can you talk a little bit about how you conceive these montages and what it’s like to execute them?', 'RS: Well, conceive them.', 'PG: Talk about, what was it like to do, Kim with the Post-it notes?', 'RS: So much fun! So that’s five, right? Rebecca.', 'PG: Written by Amy Cherkis and directed by John Shiban.', 'RS: Amy wrote that great scene that starts my journey with ""You don’t save me, I save me,"" which is also such a lovely scene to play. Then we go into this, Kim’s life, ""I’m going to do this. I’m fixing this myself."" This motto that she clings to for dear life of like ""I can fix myself."" So there was this huge montage scene and it was mostly me by myself that day. We had I think nine phone calls in total plus pocket dialogue, which is text that’s written past where you’re talking that they can use as additional dialogue. So there could be music over it or they’re going to cut in and out of it but you need to do all of it and act all of it. So it was about nine phone calls plus and then you said that you wanted it to look like it took place probably over four days. She doesn’t have an office anymore so they’re at various locations trying to find some degree of privacy. That meant that we took all of those phone calls and shot portions of them over and over in four different outfits in a variety of locations. Which actually takes a long time. It doesn’t seem like it would but it does.', 'It was an awesome day because the crew — it became like a pit crew because to get it done in 12 hours you’re also looking for a place to put on your mic and change the costume and then makeup and hair has got to fix that and prop people are trying to remember which color Post-it I had with which name on it and where it went. And I, to keep the phone calls straight so that they looked real, wrote the other half of them. I wrote the dialogue that the person would be saying back to me so that I could keep straight. You know a cold call to a friend’s mom in college is different than ""a guy that I hang out with told me that his boss may have a case for me."" There’s varying degrees of cold call and how you would speak to somebody and what they’re saying back to you so I’m trying to keep that straight with the names that are on the Post-its. And if they had turned the camera around, you have literally like this pit crew trying to change me as fast as they can and tell me what day it is and who. They were amazing.', 'Everybody helped me do it. As Bob said earlier, it is an amazing experience to think you know what you shot and then see what Kelley Dixon or Skip MacDonald or Chris Caleb in season one does with it. The fact that she displaced my dialogue from me speaking. There’s times in the montage where the dialogue is not matching my mouth and it’s even more disconcerting, you even get more how much Kim was trying to do and the ""My Way,"" which was brilliant. Who picked that?', 'PG: That was John Shiban’s choice, I believe.', 'RS: So great.', 'MM: What impressed me about that scene in particular was that I knew you were speaking to a different person each time. There were no two phone calls that were alike because there are no two people that you’re exactly alike with on the phone. Different level of ""I know you from this or this or this, don’t you remember we met here?"" Or we’ve know each other for 15 years. The timbre of the scene worked for me along with the brilliant cutting. It was every phone call was a real phone call.', 'RS: Thanks.', 'MM: I was really impressed.', 'MZS: That is a great scene and also because it’s about two things that television doesn’t usually dwell on, which is work, the actual details of work, and rejection. There’s a lot of rejection on the show. And you see them power through.', 'RS: And then you see the case taken away from me and that beautiful wide where I’m left standing by myself. I love the number of lawyers that have come up to me and said you’re right, it’s not a procedural. So we do some scenes with legalese but by and large the lawyers that have reached out to me have said like, Thank you for showing the work it takes . Like the actual grunt work and the politics of the hierarchy of getting ahead and getting squashed back down and all that. So we pay a lot of attention to detail in that.']",1

"['Penn Jillette Has Two Words For Anyone Saying You\'re ""Wasting Your Vote""']","['All it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to stand by and do nothing. That’s what has happened over the past century as the two party system has crushed dissent under their iron heel. They’ve bred ‘wasted vote’ propaganda into the country’s psyche and people have let it happen. If we ever want to break the two party stranglehold on our elections we have to stop falling for it. We need to fight back and be direct. Penn Jillette has two words for anyone that says you’re wasting your vote by voting for a third party: ""Fuck you"". Anyone that says that is empowering the corrupt system that has failed us.', 'Voting is one of the many privileges that Americans take for granted. Less than half the countries in the world have free and fair elections. Many are still run by one party dictatorships and autocrats. Luckily for us, we have had democracy in our republic since its founding. Although, we have recently given up control of the political system to a two-party duopoly. The inbred regime is not much better than a one-party state. They exert the same domination over our politics and if anyone considers voting outside the system it’s instantly labeled as wasting your vote. Nothing will change if that mindset continues.', 'People that say you’re wasting your vote are doing nothing more than telling you what to do. They’re saying ""you need to support what I believe, don’t support what you believe"". That is wrong. That is not going to do anything but make things worse than they already are. When people are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils evil still wins. The lesser evil candidate is still an evil candidate. People need to vote for what they believe in and who they think will make things better.', 'The only way to break this system is to vote for a third party candidate. The only candidate that’s on all fifty state ballots, and polling high enough to get into the Presidential debates, is Governor Gary Johnson. Penn Jillette endorsed the Governor because he’s a libertarian but anyone should be able to support what Johnson is doing. Fighting back against the duopoly that has ruined politics in this country is a crusade that all independents should be able to get behind.

Magnetic fields don’t really do anything unless the the magnitude changes. A changing magnetic field will create an electric field in the other loops. The direction of this electric field will make a change in electric potential that acts like a battery.', 'In the end, we have a device that has a potential difference that is proportional to the time rate of change of the current (since the current makes the magnetic field). This can be written as:', 'There are two things to point out in this equation. First, the L is the inductance. It only depends on the geometry of the solenoid (or whatever shape you have) and its value is measured in Henry’s. Second, there is the negative sign. This means the change in potential across the inductor opposes the change in current.', 'How does an inductor behave in a circuit? If you have a constant current, then there is no change (DC current) and thus no potential difference across the inductor—it acts like it’s not even there. If there is a high frequency current (AC circuit) then there will be a large potential difference across the inductor.', 'What is a capacitor?', 'Again, there are lots of different configurations for a capacitor. The simplest shape uses two parallel conducting plates with electric charge on each plate (but a net charge of zero).', 'The electric charge on these plates creates an electric field inside the capacitor. Since there is an electric field, there must also be a change in electric potential across the plates. The value of this potential difference depends on the amount of charge. The potential difference across the capacitor can be written as:', 'Here C is the value of the capacitance in units of Farads—it also only depends on the physical configuration of the device.', 'If there is a current going into the capacitor, the value of the charge on the plates will change. If there is a constant (or low frequency) current, this current will continue to add charge to plates to increase the electric potential so that over time, this potential will eventually act like an open circuit with the capacitor voltage equal to the battery voltage (or power supply).

First, there is no current (since the switch is open). Once the switch is closed, there can be a current and with no resistance, this current would jump up to infinity. However, this large increase in current means that there will be a change in electric potential produced across the inductor. At some point, the change in potential across the inductor will be greater than that across the capacitor (since the capacitor loses charge with current flow) and then the current will reverse directions and charge the capacitor back up. The process repeats itself—forever since there is no resistance.', 'Modeling an LC Circuit.', 'It’s called an LC circuit because it has an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C)—I guess that’s obvious. The change in electric potential around the whole circuit has to be zero (because it’s a loop) so that I can write:', 'Both Q and I are changing with time.

Together (with a diode and an earpiece) these make a crystal radio. Yes, I put this together with some simple supplies (I followed the instructions on this YouTube video). The basic idea is to adjust the values of both the capacitor and inductor to ""tune"" to a particular radio station. I couldn’t quite get it to work—I think there just aren’t any good AM radio stations around (or maybe my inductor sucked).

Fourth and eighth grade US students fall in the middle of the 59 countries in the TIMSS data set, although only 12% of US fourth graders reported high math homework loads compared to an international average of 21%.', 'So, is homework related to high academic success?', 'At a national level, the answer is clearly no.

Rather than seeing homework as a ""solution,"" policymakers should question what facets of their educational system might impel students, teachers and parents to increase homework loads.', 'At the classroom level, in setting homework, teachers need to communicate with their peers and with parents to assure that the homework assigned overall for a grade is not burdensome, and that it is indeed having a positive effect.', 'Perhaps, teachers can opt for a more individualized approach to homework. If teachers are careful in selecting their assignments – weighing the student’s age, family situation and need for skill development – then homework can be tailored in ways that improve the chance of maximum positive impact for any given student.', 'I strongly suspect that when teachers face conditions such as pressure to meet arbitrary achievement goals, lack of planning time or little autonomy over curriculum, homework becomes an easy option to make up what could not be covered in class.', 'Whatever the reason, the fact is a significant percentage of elementary school children around the world are struggling with large homework loads.

A new study in The New England Journal of Medicine argues that thinking may be wrong.', 'Researchers gathered data from four large prospective cohort studies that followed thousands of people for years, looking at the relationships between various risk factors and heart disease. The first began enrolling patients in 1987 and the last in 2008. Even though specific genes of interest weren’t known when these studies began, data were available that allowed scientists to evaluate genetic risk decades later. Using about 50 different variations — single-nucleotide polymorphisms (otherwise known as SNPs) — researchers created a risk score.', 'They also looked at how lifestyle factors were associated with outcomes. These included not smoking cigarettes, not being obese (having a B.M.I. less than 30), performing physical activity at least once a week and having a healthful diet pattern.', 'That last criterion was defined as doing at least half of the following recommendations: eating more fruits, nuts, vegetables, whole grains, fish and dairy products and eating less refined grains, processed meats, unprocessed red meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fats and sodium. Every one of the four lifestyle factors was associated with a decreased risk of coronary events.', 'Changing behavior makes a big difference in lowering the risk of heart disease, even for those people who are genetically predisposed to it.', 'That’s the first bit of good news. Doing any one of these things makes a difference.', 'But the effect is cumulative. The researchers divided people into three groups based on these factors. ""Favorable"" required at least three of the four factors, ""intermediate"" required two of them, and ""unfavorable"" required one or none. Across all studies, those with an unfavorable lifestyle had a risk that was 71 percent to 121 percent higher than those with a favorable lifestyle.', 'More impressive was the reduction in coronary events — heart attacks, bypass procedures and death from cardiovascular causes — at every level of risk. Those with a favorable lifestyle, compared with those with an unfavorable lifestyle, had a 45 percent reduction in coronary events among those at low genetic risk, a 47 percent reduction among those with intermediate genetic risk, and a 46 percent reduction among those at high genetic risk.', 'What does this mean in real-world numbers? Among those at high genetic risk in the oldest cohort study, 10.7 percent could expect to have a coronary event over a 10-year period if they had an unfavorable lifestyle. That number was reduced to 5.1 percent if they had a favorable lifestyle. Among those at low genetic risk, the 10-year event rate was 5.8 percent with an unfavorable lifestyle and 3.1 percent with a favorable lifestyle. In the other cohort studies, similar relative reductions were seen.', 'These differences aren’t small. The risk of a coronary event in 10 years was halved. The absolute reduction, more than 5 percentage points in the genetic group at high risk, means that lifestyle changes are as powerful as, if not more powerful than, many drugs we recommend and pay billions of dollars for all the time.', 'There are caveats, of course. All of the participants in these analyses were white, because there are few well-validated genetic studies in black populations. But the researchers also saw similar findings in the black population of the oldest cohort. These aren’t randomized controlled trials, and there could be other factors at play that we aren’t measuring. But the results were consistent over a number of studies, and the effect size is large.', 'There are important lessons to be learned. These results should encourage us that genetics do not determine everything about our health. Changes in lifestyle can overcome much of the risk our DNA imposes.', 'Lifestyle changes are hugely important not only for those at low risk, but for those at high risk. The relative reductions in events were similar at all levels of genetic risk.', 'Moreover, given how changes in lifestyle will also reduce your risk of other diseases like cancer (the No. 2 killer), it’s clear that a healthier lifestyle could have huge implications for many, many more people.', 'It’s important to acknowledge that these lifestyle recommendations are even less constrictive than those I’ve discussed in the past. You need only be a current nonsmoker; past smoking doesn’t exclude you. You can also be overweight, just not obese. And in contrast with most physical activity recommendations, it requires only once-a-week exercise, not the 30 minutes for five days that most professional organizations like the American Heart Association endorse.']",1

['How Julie Andrews Feels About Emily Blunt Playing Mary Poppins'],"['How Julie Andrews Feels About Emily Blunt Playing Mary Poppins By Conner Schwerdtfeger There exist few tasks in Hollywood more difficult than recasting an iconic role. This becomes even harder when the first person to take on a given role nailed it perfectly the first time around. It\'s been over 50 years since we last saw beloved British nanny, Mary Poppins, and the role will soon be handed from Julie Andrews to Emily Blunt -- who clearly has big shoes to fill. There\'s only one question: how does Andrews feel about bequeathing such an important role to a new generation? As it turns out, she\'s perfectly fine with it. Blunt explained: Rob said he was in the Hamptons, and he saw [Andrews], and he said, \'It\'s top secret, but Emily Blunt\'s playing Mary Poppins... And she went, \'Oh, wonderful!\' I felt like I wanted to cry. It was lovely to get her stamp of approval. That took the edge off it, for sure. While speaking with EW, Emily Blunt revealed that Mary Poppins Returns\' director, Rob Marshall, recently had a chance to talk to Julie Andrews about Blunt taking over the iconic role. Apparently -- like the rest of us -- Julie Andrews is a fan of Emily Blunt\'s body of work, and she\'s completely on board with the idea. The reveal of Andrews\' approval reportedly served as a huge relief to Blunt, who felt much more confident in the role knowing that the original Mary Poppins supported the casting decision. After all, even the most confident and accomplished actors can still feel the pressure in situations such as this. Recasting has become an incredibly common practice in Hollywood these days, as we live in an era defined by long-running franchises. Some characters, like Batman, get recast all of the time, and as such it has become something that we as members of the audience expect. However, certain other characters -- like Indiana Jones -- feel intrinsically linked to the performer that takes on the role. Up until recently, we very much felt that way about Julie Andrews and her portrayal of Mary Poppins, but it looks like Andrews herself has no problem with Emily Blunt filling her shoes. That being said, the act of recasting Andrews is further helped by the fact that Mary Poppins Returns will look more to the source material than the 1964 film for inspiration. The original incarnation of the character differs from Julie Andrews\' version in that Mary Poppins herself is somewhat ""meaner,"" and as such Emily Blunt cannot completely emulate Andrews\' prim and proper nanny in the evolution of the role. As a result of this, Blunt will have quite a bit more creative freedom than she would if Rob Marshall and the team behind Mary Poppins Returns had decided to do a straight remake of the original. It\'s a small detail, but it helps take this character in a new direction. We will just have to wait and see what Emily Blunt brings to the role of the iconic British Nanny. Mary Poppins Returns is currently slated to hit theaters on Christmas Day 2018. Stay tuned for more details! Blended From Around The Web Comments Facebook', 'Back to top']",1

You can get a really great Chromebook for around $200, or about one-fifth the cost of a 13-inch MacBook Air. Don't let the price fool you though. Just because Chromebooks are cheap doesn't mean they're bad. All the major computer brands like HP, Asus, and Samsung make excellent Chromebooks.

As such, I would like to appeal to your sense of professionalism. My job is to write tech news, and big product launches are a key part of that. I can – and have – covered launches remotely, but I find it is always better to physically be there, especially if you are able to talk to people who have been working on those products for years. Frustrated at not being allowed into WWDC, I did the right thing and asked ahead of time to attend the next one. We have quite a trail of emails here going back months where I have respectfully requested to attend the next big product launch. It is much easier for me to follow a webcast and write a story but I wish to invest my time and energy in digging deeper and writing more rounded articles. Whether you realize it or not, you have been quite unhelpful in that goal. I was ready to put your responses down to sheer laziness – which is surprising because Apple has never struck me as that sort of company – but when you explained it was your understanding that we did not write product reviews, I realized that with such a high-profile company you are probably fielding all sorts of unsuitable requests and mine had fallen into some kind of bucket. I feel we have resolved that misunderstanding, so it is a little disheartening to receive the same stock response about a media waiting list, especially when you seem unable or unwilling to provide even basic information about what that actually means or the likelihood of being able to attend an upcoming event. I have no doubt you are a very capable communications professional and you are most likely overloaded with work, but can I appeal to your better nature and ask you to disperse with whatever unnecessary barriers exist that are preventing Apple from simply confirming my attendance at the event next week. We can work forward from there. Thanks', ""The next morning, amazingly, the phone rings. It's Mandy from Apple's PR department and she is calling on behalf of Alan.

I got a call from someone called Mandy on Friday who said she was calling on your behalf. She left me disappointed and confused, I'm afraid to report. First off she said that the waiting list was closed. I'm not sure why she said this since you've been saying we're on the waiting list for quite a few weeks now. She also couldn't provide any more information about the list. I'm beginning to wonder whether this waitlist exists at all to be honest, since no one seems to know anything about its contents or how it functions. She then, somewhat bizarrely, offered to email a link on Monday to the webcast of tomorrow's launch. As you no doubt know, yesterday was Labor Day and everyone was on holiday – as was Mandy it seems because I never received an email. But beyond that, I'm confused as to why you would ask one of your staff to call to offer a link to a public webcast. I can only assume there was some kind of miscommunication. Sadly, all of this is making Apple look a little hapless. Honestly, I expected better from such a huge and successful organization. Anyway, getting back to the point: is there a spot available for me at the event tomorrow? If you don't know right now, when will you know latest?
