There are various approaches to our solution to the task. As mentioned in the paper, we have uploaded all the approaches here. Each approach has a seperate readme file inside the folder which containes the commands required to run the approach.

The models with suffix "feature" cotain feature vectors and the models which don't have the suffix "feature" are the models which don't have the feature vector.

"Similarity" model is indicated by "RoBERT" in the codes.

"Document Classification" model is indicated by "doc_cls"

Train, Dev and Test datapoints need to be changed in the "trainer.py" file under "models" folder present in each approach according to the problem statement.
